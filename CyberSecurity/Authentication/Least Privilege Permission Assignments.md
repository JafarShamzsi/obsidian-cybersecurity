## Core Principles

**Least privilege** is a fundamental security principle that involves granting principals (users, processes, or systems) only the minimum permissions necessary to perform authorized tasks. This principle limits the potential damage from security incidents by constraining what an attacker can do with a compromised account or system.

![[Least Privilege Definition]]

> "The principle of least privilege requires that a subject be given no more privilege than necessary to perform a job." â€” NIST Special Publication 800-179

## Conceptual Framework

### Key Components

- **Necessity-based permissions** - only what's required to complete authorized work
- **Minimal scope of rights** - limiting breadth of accessible resources
- **Time-bound privileges** - ephemeral elevated permissions when needed
- **Contextual authorization** - permissions activated in appropriate circumstances
- **Continual reassessment** - regular privilege review and adjustment

### Security Benefits

- **Reduced attack surface** - minimizing potential exploitation points
- **Limited breach impact** - containing damage from compromised accounts
- **Malware containment** - restricting malicious software propagation
- **Lateral movement prevention** - impeding attacker progression through networks
- **Simplified forensics** - clearer audit trails for security investigations

## Implementation Process

### Design Phase

![[Least Privilege Design Phase]]

1. **Business workflow analysis**
    
    - Document authorized job functions and tasks
    - Identify required systems and resources
    - Determine minimal access levels needed
2. **Role engineering**

    - Map permissions to business functions
    - Establish role hierarchies and relationships
3. **Access policy development**
    
    - Document formal access requirements
    - Define approval workflows
    - Establish temporary access procedures

### Deployment Phase

1. **Permission mapping**
    
    - Translate business requirements to technical permissions

2. **Default deny posture**
    
    - Configure systems to deny access by default
    - Explicitly enable only necessary permissions
    - Remove unnecessary default access rights
3. **Separation of duties**
    
    - Divide critical functions among multiple users
    - Prevent conflict of interest scenarios
    - Reduce fraud opportunities

### Operational Phase

1. **Privilege escalation procedures**

2. **Just-in-time (JIT) access**
    
    - Grant elevated permissions only when needed
    - Automatically revoke after task completion or timeout
    - Log all temporary privilege usage
3. **Break-glass procedures**
