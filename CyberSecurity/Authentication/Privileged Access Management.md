### 1. Definition and Scope

Privileged Access Management (PAM) refers to a comprehensive framework of policies, procedures, and technical controls designed to secure, manage, monitor, and audit accounts with elevated permissions. These controls are implemented to reduce the risk of compromise of sensitive systems, prevent privilege abuse, and ensure accountability for privileged actions.

---

### 2. Privileged Accounts

Privileged accounts possess elevated permissions that allow them to perform administrative or configuration-level operations. These accounts are significantly more sensitive than standard user accounts due to their ability to impact critical system functions.

**Examples of privileged accounts include:**

- Domain Administrator accounts (Active Directory)
    
- Local Administrator/root accounts (Windows/Linux)
    
- Database administrator accounts (e.g., Oracle SYSDBA)
    
- Application server admin accounts
    
- Privileged service accounts (non-human)
    

Privileged accounts may provide access to:

- Operating system kernel and configuration
    
- Network device administration (routers, firewalls)
    
- Hypervisors and virtualization platforms
    
- Application-level backends and APIs
    
- Security systems (e.g., SIEMs, IDPs, endpoint protection consoles)
    

---

### 3. Risk Implications

Privileged accounts are high-value targets due to their ability to:

- Alter or disable security controls
    
- Escalate access across the environment (lateral movement)
    
- Extract sensitive data or deploy malware
    
- Create persistence mechanisms
    
- Cover tracks through log manipulation
    

Excessive or unmonitored use of privileged access significantly increases the organization’s attack surface and potential for data breaches.

### 4. Core Principles of PAM

#### 4.1 Least Privilege

Privileged access should be granted only to the extent required to perform a specific task. This minimizes the blast radius in the event of credential compromise.

#### 4.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Access should be granted based on the user's assigned role. Privileges must align strictly with job responsibilities and should be periodically reviewed.

#### 4.3 Separation of Duties (SoD)

Sensitive operations should be divided across multiple users or systems to prevent fraud or unauthorized actions. For example, access approval and execution roles must be distinct.

#### 4.4 Just-in-Time (JIT) Access

Elevated access is granted only for a limited time and must be explicitly requested and approved. This supports the Zero Standing Privileges (ZSP) model.

---

### 5. Technical Implementation Models

#### 5.1 Temporary Elevation

Administrative privileges are assigned to a standard user account temporarily, either through:

- **Windows UAC**: Uses token filtering to elevate access per action.
    
- **Linux sudo**: Grants temporary root access for specific commands, with timestamped logging.
    

#### 5.2 Password Vaulting / Brokering

Privileged credentials are stored in a secure vault. Access to these credentials is time-bound and requires justification. Features include:

- Credential checkout and return workflows
    
- Automated or manual approval processes (e.g., M of N control)
    
- Session recording and full audit trails
    
- Policy enforcement for credential reuse prevention
    

**Common solutions:** CyberArk, BeyondTrust, Thycotic, HashiCorp Vault (for secrets management)

#### 5.3 Ephemeral Credentials

The system dynamically generates or enables credentials for administrative tasks. These accounts or secrets are automatically disabled or destroyed after use. This reduces the risk of credential theft or persistence.

Examples include:

- Cloud IAM temporary tokens (e.g., AWS STS)
    
- Ephemeral Active Directory group membership via identity governance tools
    

---

### 6. Secure Administrative Workstations (SAWs)

A Secure Administrative Workstation is a hardened endpoint used exclusively for privileged operations. Characteristics include:

- Minimal software footprint
    
- No general-purpose applications (email, browsers)
    
- Network segmentation from production or user subnets
    
- Continuous monitoring and patching
    

SAWs are designed to reduce exposure to malware, phishing, and credential harvesting attacks.

---

### 7. Credential Hygiene and Security Controls

- Enforce high-entropy, complex password policies for all privileged accounts.
    
- Implement multifactor authentication (MFA) or passwordless access mechanisms (e.g., smart cards, biometrics).
    
- Prevent privileged account sign-ins from untrusted or unmanaged devices.
    
- Prohibit use of shared accounts or vendor-supplied default credentials.
    
- Rotate credentials regularly and upon suspected compromise.
    

---

### 8. Logging and Monitoring

- Enable full audit logging for privileged access events.
    
- Integrate PAM systems with SIEM solutions for correlation and alerting.
    
- Record session activity including keystrokes, command execution, and video replay if applicable.
    
- Monitor for anomalous behavior, including:
    
    - Login attempts from unusual geolocations
        
    - Unauthorized privilege escalation
        
    - Repeated failed access attempts
        

---

### 9. PAM for Service Accounts

Service accounts are non-human accounts used by applications or scripts to access system resources. These accounts often require elevated access and are commonly mismanaged.

**Best practices for securing service accounts:**

- Eliminate hardcoded credentials in scripts or source code.
    
- Use secrets management solutions to inject credentials at runtime.
    
- Rotate service account passwords programmatically.
    
- Monitor service account activity and restrict permissions to the bare minimum.

### 10. Summary

Privileged Access Management is a foundational component of an organization's identity and access security strategy. Effective PAM reduces the likelihood of privilege abuse, limits the impact of credential compromise, and enhances operational accountability. By enforcing JIT access, deploying credential vaults, minimizing standing privileges, and auditing all privileged activity, organizations can meet both security and compliance objectives.### 1.
