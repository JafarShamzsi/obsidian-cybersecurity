# Summary

Impersonation and pretexting represent sophisticated psychological manipulation tactics within the social engineering attack vector family. These techniques circumvent traditional security controls by exploiting human cognitive biases and social dynamics rather than technical vulnerabilities. This technical analysis examines the methodologies, attack patterns, detection mechanisms, and defensive countermeasures for these attack vectors.

## 1. Technical Taxonomy and Attack Vectors

### 1.1 Impersonation: Technical Framework

Impersonation involves the adversary assuming the identity of a trusted entity to manipulate target behaviour. From a technical perspective, impersonation can be categorized into several distinct subclasses:

- **Digital Identity Impersonation**: Manipulation of digital identifiers including:
    
    - Email address spoofing (header manipulation/domain typosquatting)
    - SMS sender ID spoofing (exploiting SS7 protocol vulnerabilities)
    - Caller ID spoofing (SIP header manipulation)
    - Digital certificate fraud (compromised CAs or self-signed certificates)
- **Physical Identity Impersonation**: Falsification of tangible credentials:
    
    - Counterfeit access credentials (RFID cloning/NFC replay attacks)
    - Uniform/visual identity appropriation (facilitating physical intrusion)
    - Synthetic identity construction (combining legitimate and fraudulent elements)
- **Authority Impersonation**: Simulation of hierarchical power structures:
    
    - Technical support persona adoption (help desk/IT staff impersonation)
    - Executive impersonation (CEO fraud/BEC attacks)
    - Regulatory or compliance authority impersonation

### 1.2 Pretexting: Technical Framework

Pretexting extends beyond simple impersonation by establishing complex, technically-sound fictional scenarios that provide contextual legitimacy. Key technical components include:

- **Scenario Construction Architecture**:
    
    - Narrative path dependency mapping (creating coherent, believable scenarios)
    - Technical knowledge augmentation (domain-specific terminology integration)
    - Contextual technical reference implementation (industry-specific processes)
- **Operational Pretexting Patterns**:
    
    - Multi-phase engagement sequences (reconnaissance → rapport → request)
    - Technical authority leveraging (exploiting knowledge asymmetry)
    - Time-pressure inducement techniques (artificial urgency creation)
    - Technical incident simulation (crisis response manipulation)
- **Digital Infrastructure Support**:
    
    - Falsified technical documentation (forged work orders/requisitions)
    - Spoofed infrastructure (fake websites/portals with legitimate TLS certificates)
    - Manufactured digital evidence chains (creating verifiable yet fraudulent activity histories)
