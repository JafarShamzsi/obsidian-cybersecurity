### 1. Secure Administrative Workstations (SAWs)

**Secure Administrative Workstations (SAWs)** are dedicated systems used for managing critical infrastructure components such as routers, firewalls, servers, and network appliances. These endpoints are configured under strict hardening policies to reduce attack surface and enforce administrative segmentation.

#### Security Requirements for SAWs:

- **Software Minimization**: Only essential tools are installed (SSH clients, RDP clients, minimal web browser).
    
- **Internet Access Control**: Internet access is disabled or limited to vendor-specific update and support endpoints.
    
- **Endpoint Monitoring**: Must be continuously monitored using endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
    
- **Logging and Audit Trails**: All administrative actions must be logged centrally with tamper-evident mechanisms.
    
- **Authentication Control**: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA), strong password policies, and device certificates.
    
- **Network Isolation**: SAWs must be logically or physically isolated from standard user subnets.

### 2. Remote Management Channels

Administrative access channels can be categorized into two types: **In-Band** and **Out-of-Band (OOB)**.

#### 2.1 In-Band Management

In-band management utilizes the production network for remote administrative access. While cost-effective, it increases the attack surface and is dependent on the operational status of the main network infrastructure.

- **Transport Protocols**: SSH, HTTPS, RDP, SNMPv3, TLS, IPsec.
    
- **Encryption**: All management traffic must be encrypted using approved cryptographic protocols (FIPS 140-3 compliant where applicable).
    
- **Risks**:
    
    - Susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
        
    - Accessible by compromised hosts within the production network.
        
    - May fail during major network outages.
        

#### 2.2 Out-of-Band (OOB) Management

Out-of-Band management provides administrative access independent of the production network. It is considered a best practice for critical infrastructure due to its increased reliability and isolation.

- **Methods**:
    
    - Direct serial console access (RS-232).
        
    - Modem or dial-in access for remote administration.
        
    - Dedicated Ethernet interfaces mapped to a **management VLAN**.
        
    - Physically isolated management networks.
        
- **Security Controls**:
    
    - Authentication must be isolated from the production network.
        
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced for all users.
        
    - Audit logging should be centralized and protected with integrity mechanisms.

### 3. Jump Servers (Bastion Hosts)

A **Jump Server** (also referred to as a Bastion Host) is a hardened system that acts as a gateway to access systems in a secured or restricted network zone. It is designed to control and log administrative access to high-value assets.
![[image-5fab1f0e73ce1.jpg]]
#### 3.1 Functional Role

- Acts as the **sole entry point** to the management interfaces of servers in the secure zone.
    
- Isolates direct connectivity from client systems to critical infrastructure.
    
- Limits exposure of administrative protocols such as SSH and RDP.
    

#### 3.2 Architecture Model

1. **Administrator establishes a secure connection** (typically via VPN or TLS tunnel) to the jump server.
    
2. **Jump server mediates all administrative connections** to application servers and infrastructure devices.
    
3. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** on application servers allow only the jump serverâ€™s IP.
    
4. **All other direct administrative access is denied** at the network level.
    
5. **Ordinary application traffic** is routed separately and does not intersect with management traffic paths.
    

#### 3.3 Security Considerations

- **Hardening**:
    
    - Disable all unnecessary services and ports.
        
    - Restrict administrative tools to required protocols only (e.g., SSH, RDP).
        
    - Enable disk encryption and integrity verification mechanisms.
        
- **Authentication**:
    
    - Require multi-factor authentication.
        
    - Enforce SSH key-based access with certificate validation.
        
- **Monitoring and Auditing**:
    
    - Implement session recording (e.g., ttyrec, AuditD).
        
    - Integrate with SIEM for real-time analysis.
        
    - Retain audit logs in WORM (Write Once, Read Many) storage.
        
- **Change Management**:
    
    - Configuration changes must go through formal change control processes.
        
    - Regularly validate jump server configurations against secure baselines.
        

#### 3.4 Risk Mitigation

- Prevents lateral movement by isolating management access.
    
- Reduces internal attack surface by consolidating administrative entry points.
    
- Enables fine-grained auditability and accountability of privileged activity.

### 4. Operational Best Practices

- **Implement tiered access**: Separate Tier 0 (Domain Controllers, PKI) from Tier 1/2 assets.
    
- **Establish least privilege access**: Only authorize users based on job function and role.
    
- **Rotate keys and credentials**: Enforce strict key rotation policies and automatically expire old credentials.
    
- **Regular security assessments**: Conduct vulnerability scans, penetration tests, and configuration audits.
    
- **Backup and recovery plans**: Ensure OOB and jump server configurations are included in DR/BCP documentation.
