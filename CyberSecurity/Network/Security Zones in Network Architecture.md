## Overview

Security zones are segmented portions of a network that group systems with similar security requirements and trust levels. This approach implements **zone-based security topology**, enabling granular traffic control and the enforcement of the **principle of least privilege**. Security zones are typically mapped to **subnets and VLANs**, with access policies enforced through **firewalls**, **routers**, and **layer 3 switches**.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Security Zones**
A security zone is a logical or physical segment of the network, defined by:
- Level of trust
- Sensitivity of data assets
- Required security controls

### 2. **Trust Boundary**
Zones establish **trust boundaries**. Crossing a boundary requires enforcement mechanisms such as:
- Stateful inspection
- Deep packet inspection
- Explicit allow/deny rules

### 3. **Access Control Principles**
- **Default Deny**: Only explicitly allowed traffic is permitted
- **Default Allow**: All traffic is permitted unless explicitly blocked
- **Unidirectional Access**: One zone can initiate communication; the other cannot respond (used in sensitive environments)

## Zone Privilege Classification

| Zone | Name | Privilege Level | Primary Assets | Key Requirements |
|------|------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | Printer Zone | Low | Network printers | Integrity, low confidentiality |
| 2 | Client Zone | Medium | Workstations, VoIP handsets | Integrity, availability |
| 3 | Untrusted | Untrusted | Guest Wi-Fi, public app servers | Isolation, no LAN access |
| 4 | Internet | External | Public WAN | Minimal trust, outbound filtering |
| 5 | High-Privilege | High | Private app servers, DBs | Confidentiality, integrity, availability |

## Network Topology and Addressing

### Subnet and VLAN Mapping
| Subnet | Description | VLAN | Connected Assets |
|--------|-------------|------|------------------|
| 10.1.48.0/24 | Printer subnet | — | Zone 1 |
| 10.1.32.0/24 | VLAN 32 | VLAN 32 | Client devices |
| 10.1.40.0/24 | VLAN 40 | VLAN 40 | Client devices |
| 10.1.16.0/24 | VLAN 16 | VLAN 16 | App Servers |
| 10.1.24.0/24 | VLAN 24 | VLAN 24 | Database Servers |
| 192.168.42.0/24 | Guest Wi-Fi | — | Zone 3 |
| 172.16.0.0/24 | Public Servers | — | Zone 3 |
| 10.1.128.0/24 | Inline proxy/firewall subnet | — | Control Plane |

## Access Control Matrix

### Intra-Zone Rules (Same Privilege Level)
- **VLAN 32 ⟷ VLAN 40**: Block all new connections (isolate clients)
- **VLAN 16 → VLAN 24**: Allow (application servers can query databases)
- **VLAN 24 → VLAN 16**: Block (databases cannot initiate requests)

### Inter-Zone Rules

| Source Zone | Destination Zone | Policy |
|-------------|------------------|--------|
| Medium → Low | Allow (default accept) |
| Low → Medium | Deny (block all) |
| Medium → High | Deny |
| High → Medium | Allow some (specific services only) |
| Medium → Internet | Deny |
| Internet → Medium | Allow some (e.g., HTTP responses) |
| High → Internet | Typically deny |
| Untrusted ↔ Border Router | Deny (mutual block) |
| Untrusted → Internet | Allow |
| Public Servers ↔ Internet | Internet → Public: Allow<br>Public → Internet: Deny |
| Guest Wi-Fi → Internet | Allow |
| Guest Wi-Fi → LAN | Deny |

## Security Design Considerations

### Confidentiality
- Sensitive data (PII, company IP) must not be stored in low or untrusted zones.
- Data segmentation mitigates breach scope.

### Integrity
- All zones must implement security baselines:
  - Patch management
  - Endpoint protection (AV, EDR)
  - Controlled administrative access

### Availability
- Critical services (DNS, authentication, VoIP) require high availability design.
- Zones hosting such services must be redundantly connected and monitored.

---

## Architectural Enforcement

### Entry/Exit Points
- Each zone must have a clearly defined **entry/exit point**, typically via:
  - Layer 3 switches
  - Firewalls
  - Inline proxy appliances

### Control Mechanisms
- **Firewalls** enforce access policies.
- **ACLs (Access Control Lists)** control VLAN-to-VLAN communication.
- **NAC (Network Access Control)** enforces endpoint compliance before granting access.
- **Segmentation Policies** enforce East-West traffic control (lateral movement prevention).

---

## Best Practices

1. **Segment by Function & Sensitivity**:
   - Isolate user devices, servers, and IoT.
   - Separate production from development environments.

2. **Limit Cross-Zone Communication**:
   - Apply **Zero Trust**: No implicit trust based on network location.
   - Use allowlists instead of denylists.

3. **Monitor Inter-Zone Traffic**:
   - Deploy IDS/IPS sensors on key junctions.
   - Log and alert on suspicious access attempts.

4. **Enforce Least Privilege**:
   - Limit which services can traverse zone boundaries.
   - Disable unused ports and protocols.

5. **Secure Wireless Access**:
   - Never bridge internal zones with guest Wi-Fi.
   - Use separate VLANs and routing paths for guest access.

## Conclusion

A well-architected zone-based security topology is a foundational element of enterprise cybersecurity. It enforces structured control over communication paths, reduces attack surface, and enables response containment in the event of a breach. The effectiveness of this model depends on rigorous **policy enforcement**, continuous **monitoring**, and periodic **auditing** of inter-zone permissions.
