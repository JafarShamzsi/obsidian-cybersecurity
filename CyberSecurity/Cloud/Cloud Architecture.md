## 1. Serverless Computing

### Definition and Core Concept
Serverless computing is a cloud-native execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. Applications are decomposed into stateless functions that are triggered by events and are ephemeral in nature.

Serverless computing is often referred to as **Function as a Service (FaaS)** and represents a shift away from traditional infrastructure-centric models toward service-based abstraction, wherein execution, scaling, fault tolerance, and load balancing are inherently managed by the cloud provider.

### Key Characteristics

| Attribute                | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Infrastructure Management | Abstracted; fully managed by the cloud provider                            |
| Deployment Units         | Stateless functions or microservices                                        |
| Trigger Mechanism        | Event-driven (HTTP requests, message queues, file uploads, DB changes, etc.)|
| Billing Model            | Pay-per-execution (based on memory usage and execution time)               |
| Scaling                  | Automatic scaling at the function level                                     |
| Availability             | High availability and fault tolerance managed by the provider               |

### Leading Serverless Platforms
- AWS Lambda  
- Google Cloud Functions  
- Azure Functions  
- IBM Cloud Functions (Apache OpenWhisk)

### Practical Use Cases
- Mobile and Web Backends  
- Event-driven Data Pipelines  
- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants

- Security Event Triggers  

### Security Considerations

#### Execution Environment
- Ephemeral, sandboxed containers

#### IAM and Privilege Management
- Use least privilege and time-bound credentials  
- Avoid over-privileged roles

#### Input Validation
- Sanitize all external inputs  
- Harden API boundaries

#### Dependency Management
- Scan for vulnerable packages  
- Limit third-party code

#### Observability
- Use native logging/tracing tools (CloudWatch, X-Ray)  
- Aggregate and correlate logs across ephemeral executions

#### Compliance
- Be aware of multi-region execution  
- Evaluate compliance needs (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

## 2. Microservices

### Definition
Microservices architecture decomposes applications into loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is focused on a specific business capability.

### Core Architectural Principles

| Principle                  | Description                                                              |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single Responsibility      | One business function per service                                        |
| Autonomous Deployment      | Independent CI/CD pipelines and deployment                              |
| Decentralized Governance   | Teams choose tech stack per service                                      |
| API-Driven Communication   | Communication via REST, gRPC, message queues                             |
| Resilience and Isolation   | Isolated failure domains                                                 |

### Benefits
- Greater development agility  
- Independent scalability  
- Enhanced fault isolation  
- Heterogeneous technology stacks

### Security Challenges

#### API Exposure
- Harden API endpoints with rate limiting and authentication  
- Use API Gateway and Web Application Firewalls (WAF)

#### Service-to-Service Security
- Encrypt all traffic with mTLS  
- Use service mesh for policy enforcement and telemetry

#### Data Security
- Encrypt at rest and in transit  
- Implement access control at the datastore level

#### Container Security
- Image scanning, runtime security, minimal base images  
- Leverage tools like Falco, AppArmor, Trivy

#### Secrets Management
- Centralized vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)  
- Rotate secrets regularly

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Declarative templates for repeatable deployment  
- Use Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation  
- Ensure environment parity and version control

## 3. Transformational Changes in Cloud-Native Architecture

### Paradigm Shift
The cloud redefines infrastructure and application development with modular, elastic, and service-centric approaches.

### Core Cloud Services and Their Roles

| Service Area                     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Elastic Compute & Auto-scaling   | Adjust compute dynamically based on load                                   |
| CDNs                             | Improve latency by serving content globally                                |
| Object Storage                   | Scalable blob storage (e.g., AWS S3)                                        |
| IAM                              | Centralized identity and RBAC for cloud resources                          |

| Event-Driven Architecture        | Real-time response to events using queues, streams, pub/sub                |

### Cybersecurity Implications

#### Configuration Complexity
- Risk: Misconfigured buckets, permissive roles, insecure security groups  
- Mitigation: CSPM tools (e.g., Wiz, Orca, Prisma Cloud)

#### Shadow IT and Sprawl
- Risk: Unvetted services increase attack surface  
- Mitigation: Cloud asset inventory and policy enforcement

#### Shared Responsibility Model
- Provider secures infra; client must secure data, access, and app logic

#### Expanded Attack Surface
- Each managed service and API is a potential entry point  
- Conduct regular attack surface audits

#### Compliance and Auditability
- Use real-time audit logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail)  
- Enforce policy-as-code and continuous compliance

## Summary

The adoption of serverless computing and microservices architectures represents a fundamental shift in application development, deployment, and operational strategies. While these paradigms provide immense scalability, agility, and efficiency, they also introduce complex cybersecurity challenges that demand modern, layered defense strategies, automated policy enforcement, and deep observability.
