# Security Concepts Relationship Map

This map shows how the fundamental security concepts we've studied so far interconnect:

## Core Concepts Hierarchy

1. **Information Security** (Overarching discipline)
    
    - Focuses on protecting data resources
    - Governed by the [[CIA Triad]]
    - Extended by concepts like non-repudiation
2. **Cybersecurity** (Subset of Information Security)
    
    - Focuses specifically on securing digital assets and systems
    - Implemented through frameworks like [[NIST Cybersecurity Framework]]
    - Organizes security practices into functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)
3. **Frameworks Implementation**
    
    - Guided by [[Gap Analysis]]
    - Measures current state against desired state
    - Prioritizes remediation activities

## Conceptual Flow

```
Information Security → CIA Triad → Cybersecurity → NIST CSF → Gap Analysis → Security Controls → Remediation
```

## Practical Application

When implementing security in an organization:

1. Start with understanding Information Security principles (CIA)
2. Select appropriate Cybersecurity framework (NIST CSF)
3. Perform Gap Analysis to identify weaknesses
4. Implement Security Controls to address gaps
5. Continuously monitor and improve

This cycle ensures a comprehensive and structured approach to security implementation.
