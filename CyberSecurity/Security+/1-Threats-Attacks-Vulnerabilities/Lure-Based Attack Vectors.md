## Overview

Lure-based vectors are social engineering techniques that exploit human psychology by presenting something attractive or interesting that entices targets to take actions that compromise security. When victims interact with the lure, it delivers a malicious payload that typically gives attackers control over the system or disrupts services.

## Common Lure-Based Attack Vectors

### Removable Devices

Attackers conceal malware on physical media to bypass network security controls:

- **USB Thumb Drives**: Can be configured to:
    
    - Auto-execute malware using Windows AutoRun/AutoPlay features
    - Emulate keyboards (BadUSB) to inject commands
    - Exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in USB handlers
- **Drop Attack Tactics**:
    
    - Strategic placement in parking lots, reception areas, and office grounds
    - Labeling devices with intriguing text ("Confidential," "Salary Information," "2025 Strategic Plan")
    - Branding devices with company or popular logos
    - Success rates average 45-60% according to penetration testing studies
- **Defense Strategies**:
    
    - Disable AutoRun/AutoPlay functionality
    - Implement USB port control software/hardware
    - Deploy Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions
    - Conduct regular security awareness training

### Executable Files

Malicious software disguised as legitimate or desirable applications:

- **Trojan Horse Malware Types**:
    
    - **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**: Establish backdoor connections
    - **Banking Trojans**: Steal financial credentials
    - **Downloader Trojans**: Install additional malware
    - **Fake Antivirus**: Pose as security software while actually being malware
- **Common Disguises**:
    
    - Free games or entertainment software
    - Cracked commercial software
    - System utilities or optimizers
    - Browser extensions or plugins
    - Screen savers or themes
- **Delivery Methods**:
    
    - Email attachments
    - Malicious website downloads
    - Peer-to-peer file sharing networks
    - Compromised app stores
    - Third-party download sites
- **Defense Strategies**:
    
    - Application whitelisting
    - Software restriction policies
    - Up-to-date antivirus/anti-malware
    - User Account Control (UAC) enforcement
    - Principle of least privilege implementation

### Document Files

Exploit documents rely on macros, scripting features, or vulnerabilities in document processing applications:

- **Common Malicious Document Types**:
    
    - **Macro-enabled Office Files**: .docm, .xlsm, .pptm
    - **PDF Files**: Exploit Adobe Reader vulnerabilities or JavaScript execution
    - **RTF Files**: Exploit Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) vulnerabilities
    - **XML Files**: XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
- **Attack Techniques**:
    
    - **Macro Malware**: Obfuscated VBA code that executes when enabled
    - **Exploit Kits**: Target vulnerabilities in document readers
    - **Steganography**: Hide malicious code within document metadata or images
    - **DDE Attacks**: Dynamic Data Exchange without macros
- **Real-World Examples**:
    
    - Emotet banking trojan often spread via macro-enabled documents
    - URSNIF malware distributed through invoice-themed documents
    - Lazarus APT group's use of malicious Microsoft Office documents
- **Defense Strategies**:
    
    - Disable macros by default (especially those from the internet)
    - Implement sandboxed document viewers
    - Keep document applications fully patched
    - Use Protected View for documents from external sources

### Image Files

Images can conceal malicious code through various techniques:

- **Image-Based Attack Methods**:
    
    - **Image Rendering Vulnerabilities**: Exploit weaknesses in how applications process image data
    - **Steganography**: Hide executable code within image data
    - **Polyglot Files**: Files that are both valid images and another file type (like JavaScript)
    - **Format Exploits**: Target vulnerabilities in specific image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF)
- **Attack Techniques**:
    
    - **Buffer Overflow**: Exploiting memory allocation in image processors
    - **SVG Exploitation**: Embedding JavaScript within SVG XML
    - **Malicious EXIF Data**: Hiding scripts in image metadata
    - **Image Spray Attacks**: Using crafted images as part of larger exploit chains
- **Defense Strategies**:
    
    - Block unnecessary image formats
    - Implement image content filtering
    - Disable automatic image loading in emails
    - Use image processing libraries with security focus

## Advanced Lure-Based Techniques

### Spear Phishing

Highly targeted lure-based attacks customized for specific individuals:

- **Characteristics**:
    
    - Research-based personalization
    - Impersonation of trusted entities (colleagues, partners, services)
    - Context-aware messaging that aligns with victim's job or recent activities
    - Often part of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns
- **Example Scenario**: Targeted executive receives an email that appears to be from a board member with an "urgent board meeting agenda" document containing exploits.
    

### QR Code Attacks (Quishing)

QR codes serve as physical or digital lures:

- **Attack Methods**:
    
    - Malicious URLs embedded in QR codes
    - Codes that trigger automatic actions when scanned
    - Overlaying fake QR codes on legitimate ones
- **Common Applications**:
    
    - Directing to credential phishing sites
    - Initiating malware downloads
    - Triggering payment requests
    - Executing commands on vulnerable scanners
- **Defense Strategies**:
    
    - Verify QR destinations before taking action
    - Use QR scanning apps with security features
    - Inspect physical QR codes for tampering
    - Apply URL filtering even for QR-originated links

### Watering Hole Attacks

Compromising websites frequently visited by the target:

- **Attack Process**:
    
    - Identify websites commonly used by the target organization
