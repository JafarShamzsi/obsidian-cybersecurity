## Overview

A **supply chain** encompasses the end-to-end process of designing, manufacturing, and distributing goods and services to customers. Supply chain attacks occur when threat actors compromise an organization by targeting less-secure elements in its supply network rather than attacking the target directly. These attacks exploit the trust relationships between organizations and their suppliers, vendors, or business partners.

## Supply Chain Components and Relationships

### Key Entities in a Supply Chain

- **Manufacturers**: Create original products
- **Suppliers**: Obtain products directly from manufacturers to sell in bulk to businesses (B2B)
- **Vendors**: Obtain products from suppliers to sell to retail businesses (B2B) or customers (B2C)
- **Business Partners**: Entities with closely aligned goals and marketing opportunities
- **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)**: Companies that provide outsourced IT services
- **Distributors/Couriers**: Handle physical transportation of goods
- **End Users**: Ultimate consumers of products or services
