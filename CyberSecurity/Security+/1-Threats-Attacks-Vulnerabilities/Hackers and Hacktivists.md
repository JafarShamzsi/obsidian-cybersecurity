### Evaluating Risk from Threat Actor Types

Understanding the general strategies and motivations of different threat actors helps businesses assess the risks they pose. Hackers and hacktivists represent two significant categories of cyber threats.

### **Hackers**

A **hacker** is an individual with the technical skills to gain access to computer systems through unauthorized or approved means.

Originally, the term "hacker" had a neutral meaning, referring to highly skilled programmers and system administrators. Hacking was seen as a demonstration of technical expertise and creativity. However, over time, it became associated with **illegal or malicious activities**.

To differentiate motivations, modern terminology classifies hackers as:

- **Unauthorized Hackers** (previously known as black hat hackers) – Engage in cyberattacks without permission, often for personal gain or malicious purposes.
- **Authorized Hackers** (previously known as white hat hackers) – Seek authorization to conduct penetration testing on systems to improve security.

#### **Unskilled Attackers**

- Also known as **script kiddies**, these individuals use pre-existing hacking tools without fully understanding how they work.
- They typically lack the ability to craft new attacks but may still pose a risk.
- Their goals may include gaining attention, proving their skills, or causing disruption without a clear objective.

### **Hacker Teams and Hacktivists**

While hackers were historically seen as **lone individuals**, today, many operate as **part of a team or group**. This collaboration allows them to develop more sophisticated tools and attack methods.

#### **Hacktivists**

A **hacktivist** is a hacker or group that uses cyberattacks to promote a **political, social, or ideological** agenda.

##### **Common Hacktivist Tactics**

1. **Data Exfiltration** – Stealing confidential information and releasing it to the public (e.g., whistleblowing).
2. **Service Disruption** – Conducting **DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks** to take down websites and services.
3. **Website Defacement** – Altering websites to spread propaganda or misinformation.

##### **Primary Targets**

- Political organizations
- Media companies
- Financial institutions
- Large corporations
- Entities perceived as harming the environment or animal rights

Businesses operating in these sectors should be particularly cautious of hacktivist activity.
