## Overview

Security teams must identify potential attack vectors against their systems through assessments involving vulnerability, threat, and risk. Understanding these three interconnected concepts is fundamental to implementing effective security controls and performing accurate risk assessments.

## Key Concepts

- **Vulnerability**: A weakness that could be triggered accidentally or exploited intentionally to cause a security breach.
- **Threat**: The potential for someone or something to exploit a vulnerability and breach security.
- **Risk**: The level of hazard posed by vulnerabilities and threats, calculated as the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited multiplied by the impact of a successful exploit.

## Vulnerability

- A weakness that could lead to a security breach
- Can be triggered accidentally or exploited intentionally
- Examples include:
    - Improperly configured or installed hardware or software
    - Delays in applying and testing software and firmware patches
    - Poorly designed network architecture
    - Inadequate physical security
    - Insecure password usage
    - Design flaws in software or operating systems
- Severity depends on:
    - Value of the vulnerable asset
    - Ease of exploiting the vulnerability

## Threat

- The potential for exploitation of a vulnerability
- Can have intentional or unintentional motivation
- Key terms:
    - **Threat Actor/Agent**: The person or thing that poses the threat
    - **Threat Vector**: The path or tool used by a malicious threat actor

## Risk

- The level of hazard posed by vulnerabilities and threats
- Calculated as: Risk = Likelihood × Impact
- Likelihood represents the probability of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability
- Impact represents the potential damage or consequences of a successful exploit

## Formula for Risk Assessment

```
Risk = Vulnerability + Threat
Risk = Impact × Likelihood
```

## Real-World Applications

- A bank might identify weak authentication as a vulnerability, phishing as a threat, and calculate the risk of account compromise as high due to both high likelihood and high impact
- A medical device manufacturer might identify firmware flaws as vulnerabilities, malware as a threat, and calculate risk based on patient safety impact
- A web application might identify SQL injection as a vulnerability, hackers as threat actors, and assess risk based on data sensitivity

## Exam Tips

- Remember that risk is always calculated using both likelihood and impact
- Know the difference between a threat agent (who/what poses the threat) and a threat vector (how they deliver the attack)
- Understand that vulnerabilities alone don't create risk—there must be a corresponding threat
- Be prepared to identify common vulnerabilities from descriptions of systems or processes
- Remember that risk calculations help prioritize which vulnerabilities to address first

## Practice Questions

1. If an organization identifies a vulnerability in their system but there is no threat that could exploit it, what would be the resulting risk level?
    - A. High risk
    - B. Medium risk
    - C. Low risk
    - D. No risk
    - Answer: C. Low risk. Even with no current threat, there is still some potential risk as new threats emerge constantly.
2. Which of the following is best described as a vulnerability?
    - A. A hacker attempting to access the system
    - B. Unpatched software on a server
    - C. The likelihood of data theft
    - D. A phishing email
    - Answer: B. Unpatched software on a server is a weakness that could be exploited, making it a vulnerability.
3. In the equation Risk = Impact × Likelihood, what does "Likelihood" represent?
    - A. The value of the vulnerable asset
    - B. The probability of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability
    - C. The amount of damage if an exploit succeeds
    - D. The number of vulnerabilities in a system
    - Answer: B. Likelihood represents the probability that a threat actor will exploit a vulnerability.
