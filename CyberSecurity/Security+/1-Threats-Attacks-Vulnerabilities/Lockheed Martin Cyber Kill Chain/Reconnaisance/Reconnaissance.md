## What is Reconnaissance?

Reconnaissance (Recon) is the critical first stage of cyber attacks and defensive security assessments, representing the systematic process of gathering information about a target system, network, or organization. It's fundamentally an intelligence collection phase where attackers or security professionals systematically collect and analyze available information to understand potential vulnerabilities and entry points.](<Reconnaissance: Laying the Foundation for Cyberattacks

The Reconnaissance stage is the initial phase of the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain, where attackers gather information about their intended target . This crucial step is akin to a criminal surveying a building before attempting an intrusion . The goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities, understand the target's network infrastructure, learn about its employees, and discover any weaknesses that can be exploited in subsequent stages . This information gathering can be passive, using publicly available sources, or active, involving direct interaction with the target's systems . The depth and breadth of information gathered during reconnaissance significantly influence the attacker's strategy and the likelihood of a successful breach.

## Core Objectives of Reconnaissance

### Information Gathering Goals

- Identify target infrastructure
- Map network topology
- Discover potential vulnerabilities
- Understand organizational structure
- Collect technical and human intelligence

## Types of Reconnaissance

### 1. Passive Reconnaissance

#### Characteristics

- No direct interaction with target systems
- Uses publicly available information
- Minimal detection risk
- Information gathered from:
    - Public websites
    - Social media
    - Search engines
    - Public records
    - Professional networking sites

### 2. Active Reconnaissance

#### Characteristics

- Direct interaction with target systems
- Higher detection probability
- Involves:
    - Network scanning
    - Port probing
    - Direct system interaction
    - Technical validation of gathered information

## Reconnaissance Methodology

### Information Collection Domains

1. Technical Intelligence
    - Network infrastructure details
    - IP ranges
    - Domain information
    - Technology stack
    - Open ports and services
2. Human Intelligence
    - Employee information
    - Organizational structure
    - Contact details
    - Potential social engineering vectors
