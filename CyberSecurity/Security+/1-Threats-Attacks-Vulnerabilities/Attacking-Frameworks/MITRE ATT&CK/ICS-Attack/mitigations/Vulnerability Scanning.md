## M1016

Vulnerability scanning is used to find potentially exploitable software vulnerabilities to remediate them.


### Techniques Addressed by Mitigation

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Exploitation of Remote Services\|T1210]] | Exploitation of Remote Services | Regularly scan the internal network for available services to identify new and potentially vulnerable services. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Exploit Public-Facing Application\|T1190]] | Exploit Public-Facing Application | Regularly scan externally facing systems for vulnerabilities and establish procedures to rapidly patch systems when critical vulnerabilities are discovered through scanning and through public disclosure.(Citation: OWASP Top 10) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools\|T1195.001]] | Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools | Continuous monitoring of vulnerability sources and the use of automatic and manual code review tools should also be implemented as well.(Citation: OWASP Top 10) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Supply Chain Compromise\|T1195]] | Supply Chain Compromise | Continuous monitoring of vulnerability sources and the use of automatic and manual code review tools should also be implemented as well.(Citation: OWASP Top 10) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Compromise Software Supply Chain\|T1195.002]] | Compromise Software Supply Chain | Continuous monitoring of vulnerability sources and the use of automatic and manual code review tools should also be implemented as well.(Citation: OWASP Top 10) |
