## M1045

Enforce binary and application integrity with digital signature verification to prevent untrusted code from executing.


### Techniques Addressed by Mitigation

| --- | --- | --- |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Server Software Component\|T1505]] | Server Software Component | Ensure all application component binaries are signed by the correct application developers. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Malicious Image\|T1204.003]] | Malicious Image | Utilize a trust model such as Docker Content Trust with digital signatures to ensure runtime verification of the integrity and publisher of specific image tags.(Citation: Content trust in Docker)(Citation: Content trust in Azure Container Registry) |
