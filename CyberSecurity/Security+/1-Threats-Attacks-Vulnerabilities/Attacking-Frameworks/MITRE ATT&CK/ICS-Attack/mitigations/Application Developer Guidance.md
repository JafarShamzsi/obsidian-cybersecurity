## M1013

This mitigation describes any guidance or training given to developers of applications to avoid introducing security weaknesses that an adversary may be able to take advantage of.


### Techniques Addressed by Mitigation

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Plist File Modification\|T1647]] | Plist File Modification | Ensure applications are using Apple's developer guidance which enables hardened runtime.(Citation: Apple Developer Doco Hardened Runtime) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Supply Chain Compromise\|T1195]] | Supply Chain Compromise | Application developers should be cautious when selecting third-party libraries to integrate into their application. Additionally, where possible, developers should lock software dependencies to specific versions rather than pulling the latest version on build.(Citation: Cider Security Top 10 CICD Security Risks) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Hijack Execution Flow\|T1574]] | Hijack Execution Flow | When possible, include hash values in manifest files to help prevent side-loading of malicious libraries.(Citation: FireEye DLL Side-Loading) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Hide Artifacts\|T1564]] | Hide Artifacts | Application developers should consider limiting the requirements for custom or otherwise difficult to manage file/folder exclusions. Where possible, install applications to trusted system folder paths that are already protected by restricted file and directory permissions. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Exploitation for Credential Access\|T1212]] | Exploitation for Credential Access | Application developers should consider taking measures to validate authentication requests by enabling one-time passwords, providing timestamps or sequence numbers for messages sent, using digital signatures, and/or using random session keys.(Citation: Comparitech Replay Attack)(Citation: Bugcrowd Replay Attack) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/File／Path Exclusions\|T1564.012]] | File／Path Exclusions | Application developers should consider limiting the requirements for custom or otherwise difficult to manage file/folder exclusions. Where possible, install applications to trusted system folder paths that are already protected by restricted file and directory permissions. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Application Access Token\|T1550.001]] | Application Access Token | Consider implementing token binding strategies, such as Azure AD token protection or OAuth Proof of Possession, that cryptographically bind a token to a secret. This may prevent the token from being used without knowledge of the secret or possession of the device the token is tied to.(Citation: Microsoft Token Protection 2023)(Citation: Okta DPoP 2023) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/XPC Services\|T1559.003]] | XPC Services | Enable the Hardened Runtime capability when developing applications. Do not include the <code>com.apple.security.get-task-allow</code> entitlement with the value set to any variation of true.  |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Use Alternate Authentication Material\|T1550]] | Use Alternate Authentication Material | Consider implementing token binding strategies, such as Azure AD token protection or OAuth Proof of Possession, that cryptographically bind a token to a secret. This may prevent the token from being used without knowledge of the secret or possession of the device the token is tied to.(Citation: Microsoft Token Protection 2023)(Citation: Okta DPoP 2023) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Code Repositories\|T1593.003]] | Code Repositories | Application developers uploading to public code repositories should be careful to avoid publishing sensitive information such as credentials and API keys. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Valid Accounts\|T1078]] | Valid Accounts | Ensure that applications do not store sensitive data or credentials insecurely. (e.g. plaintext credentials in code, published credentials in repositories, or credentials in public cloud storage). |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Resource Forking\|T1564.009]] | Resource Forking | Configure applications to use the application bundle structure which leverages the <code>/Resources</code> folder location.(Citation: Apple App Security Overview)  |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/DLL Side-Loading\|T1574.002]] | DLL Side-Loading | When possible, include hash values in manifest files to help prevent side-loading of malicious libraries.(Citation: FireEye DLL Side-Loading) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools\|T1195.001]] | Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools | Application developers should be cautious when selecting third-party libraries to integrate into their application. Additionally, where possible, developers should lock software dependencies to specific versions rather than pulling the latest version on build.(Citation: Cider Security Top 10 CICD Security Risks) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Search Open Websites／Domains\|T1593]] | Search Open Websites／Domains | Application developers uploading to public code repositories should be careful to avoid publishing sensitive information such as credentials and API keys. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Inter-Process Communication\|T1559]] | Inter-Process Communication | Enable the Hardened Runtime capability when developing applications. Do not include the <code>com.apple.security.get-task-allow</code> entitlement with the value set to any variation of true.  |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/ICS-Attack/techniques/Plist Modification\|T1547.011]] | Plist Modification | Ensure applications are using Apple's developer guidance which enables hardened runtime.(Citation: Apple Developer Doco Hardened Runtime) |
