### Techniques Addressed by Mitigation

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Supply Chain Compromise\|T1195]] | Supply Chain Compromise | Use secure methods to boot a system and verify the integrity of the operating system and loading mechanisms. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/System Firmware\|T1542.001]] | System Firmware | Check the integrity of the existing BIOS or EFI to determine if it is vulnerable to modification. Use Trusted Platform Module technology. (Citation: TCG Trusted Platform Module) Move system's root of trust to hardware to prevent tampering with the SPI flash memory.(Citation: ESET LoJax Sept 2018) Technologies such as Intel Boot Guard can assist with this.

| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Bootkit\|T1542.003]] | Bootkit | Use Trusted Platform Module technology and a secure or trusted boot process to prevent system integrity from being compromised. (Citation: TCG Trusted Platform Module) (Citation: TechNet Secure Boot Process) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Patch System Image\|T1601.001]] | Patch System Image | Some vendors of embedded network devices provide cryptographic signing to ensure the integrity of operating system images at boot time.  Implement where available, following vendor guidelines. (Citation: Cisco IOS Software Integrity Assurance - Secure Boot) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Compromise Hardware Supply Chain\|T1195.003]] | Compromise Hardware Supply Chain | Use Trusted Platform Module technology and a secure or trusted boot process to prevent system integrity from being compromised. Check the integrity of the existing BIOS or EFI to determine if it is vulnerable to modification. (Citation: TCG Trusted Platform Module) (Citation: TechNet Secure Boot Process) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/ROMMONkit\|T1542.004]] | ROMMONkit | Enable secure boot features to validate the digital signature of the boot environment and system image using a special purpose hardware device. If the validation check fails, the device will fail to boot preventing loading of unauthorized software. (Citation: Cisco IOS Software Integrity Assurance - Secure Boot)  |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Code Signing Policy Modification\|T1553.006]] | Code Signing Policy Modification | Use of Secure Boot may prevent some implementations of modification to code signing policies.(Citation: Microsoft TESTSIGNING Feb 2021) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Modify System Image\|T1601]] | Modify System Image | Some vendors of embedded network devices provide cryptographic signing to ensure the integrity of operating system images at boot time.  Implement where available, following vendor guidelines. (Citation: Cisco IOS Software Integrity Assurance - Secure Boot) |

Implement where available, following vendor guidelines. (Citation: Cisco IOS Software Integrity Assurance - Secure Boot) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Pre-OS Boot\|T1542]] | Pre-OS Boot | Use Trusted Platform Module technology and a secure or trusted boot process to prevent system integrity from being compromised. Check the integrity of the existing BIOS or EFI to determine if it is vulnerable to modification. (Citation: TCG Trusted Platform Module) (Citation: TechNet Secure Boot Process) |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Firmware Corruption\|T1495]] | Firmware Corruption | Check the integrity of the existing BIOS and device firmware to determine if it is vulnerable to modification. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/TFTP Boot\|T1542.005]] | TFTP Boot | Enable secure boot features to validate the digital signature of the boot environment and system image using a special purpose hardware device. If the validation check fails, the device will fail to boot preventing loading of unauthorized software. (Citation: Cisco IOS Software Integrity Assurance - Secure Boot)  |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/System Firmware\|T1019]] | System Firmware | Check the integrity of the existing BIOS or EFI to determine if it is vulnerable to modification.
