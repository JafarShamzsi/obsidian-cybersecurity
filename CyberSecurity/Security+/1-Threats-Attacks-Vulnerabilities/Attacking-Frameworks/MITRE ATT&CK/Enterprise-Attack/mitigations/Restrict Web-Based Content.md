### Techniques Addressed by Mitigation

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Content Injection\|T1659]] | Content Injection | Consider blocking download/transfer and execution of potentially uncommon file types known to be used in adversary campaigns. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Bidirectional Communication\|T1102.002]] | Bidirectional Communication | Web proxies can be used to enforce external network communication policy that prevents use of unauthorized external services. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Spearphishing Link\|T1566.002]] | Spearphishing Link | Determine if certain websites that can be used for spearphishing are necessary for business operations and consider blocking access if activity cannot be monitored well or if it poses a significant risk. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Steal Application Access Token\|T1528]] | Steal Application Access Token | Administrators can block end-user consent to OAuth applications, disabling users from authorizing third-party apps through OAuth 2.0 and forcing administrative consent for all requests. They can also block end-user registration of applications by their users, to reduce risk. A Cloud Access Security Broker can also be used to ban applications.<br /><br />Azure offers a couple of enterprise policy settings in the Azure Management Portal that may help:<br /><br />"Users -> User settings -> App registrations: Users can register applications" can be set to "no" to prevent users from registering new applications. <br />"Enterprise applications -> User settings -> Enterprise applications: Users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf" can be set to "no" to prevent users from consenting to allow third-party multi-tenant applications |

However, rather than providing high-level guidance on this, be extremely specificâ€”include a list of per-approved applications and deny all others not on the list. Administrators may also block end-user consent through administrative portals, such as the Azure Portal, disabling users from authorizing third-party apps through OAuth and forcing administrative consent.(Citation: Microsoft Azure AD Admin Consent) |
