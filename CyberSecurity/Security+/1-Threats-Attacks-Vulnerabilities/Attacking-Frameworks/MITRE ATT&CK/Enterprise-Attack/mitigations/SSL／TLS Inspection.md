| --- | --- | --- |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Domain Fronting\|T1090.004]] | Domain Fronting | If it is possible to inspect HTTPS traffic, the captures can be analyzed for connections that appear to be domain fronting. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Asymmetric Cryptography\|T1573.002]] | Asymmetric Cryptography | SSL/TLS inspection can be used to see the contents of encrypted sessions to look for network-based indicators of malware communication protocols. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Encrypted Channel\|T1573]] | Encrypted Channel | SSL/TLS inspection can be used to see the contents of encrypted sessions to look for network-based indicators of malware communication protocols. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Proxy\|T1090]] | Proxy | If it is possible to inspect HTTPS traffic, the captures can be analyzed for connections that appear to be domain fronting. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/techniques/Standard Cryptographic Protocol\|T1032]] | Standard Cryptographic Protocol | SSL/TLS inspection can be used to see the contents of encrypted sessions to look for network-based indicators of malware communication protocols. |
