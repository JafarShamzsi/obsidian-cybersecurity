## T1078.002

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a domain account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion.(Citation: TechNet Credential Theft) Domain accounts are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.(Citation: Microsoft AD Accounts)

Adversaries may compromise domain accounts, some with a high level of privileges, through various means such as [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) or password reuse, allowing access to privileged resources of the domain.

### Mitigations

| ID | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/mitigations/User Training\|M1017]] | User Training | Applications may send push notifications to verify a login as a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA). Train users to only accept valid push notifications and to report suspicious push notifications. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Mobile-Attack/mitigations/Privileged Account Management\|M1026]] | Privileged Account Management | Audit domain account permission levels routinely to look for situations that could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account. Do not put user or admin domain accounts in the local administrator groups across systems unless they are tightly controlled and use of accounts is segmented, as this is often equivalent to having a local administrator account with the same password on all systems. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers. Limit credential overlap across systems to prevent access if account credentials are obtained. |
| [[CyberSecurity/Security+/1-Threats-Attacks-Vulnerabilities/Attacking-Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/Enterprise-Attack/techniques/Multi-Factor Authentication\|M1032]] | Multi-factor Authentication | Integrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to cloud resources and APIs. |
