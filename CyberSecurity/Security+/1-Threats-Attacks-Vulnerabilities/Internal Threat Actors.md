## Introduction

Internal threat actors represent one of the most challenging security concerns for organizations, as these individuals already possess legitimate access to systems and data. Unlike external threats who must first breach perimeter defenses, internal actors operate from positions of trust and privilege. This document examines the technical aspects, motivations, and classifications of internal threats as covered in the CompTIA Security+ certification.

## Classification of Internal Threat Actors

### Permanent Access Insiders

- **Employees**: Personnel with ongoing, authorized access to organizational systems
    - Regular staff with standard user privileges
    - System administrators with elevated privileges
    - Executive leadership with access to sensitive business information
    - IT personnel with broad technical access rights
    - Database administrators with direct data access

### Temporary Access Insiders

- **Contractors**: Third-party workers granted limited-duration access
    - IT service providers
    - Project-based consultants
    - Temporary staff augmentation personnel
    - Outsourced development teams
- **Guests**: Short-term visitors with minimal access rights
    - Vendor representatives
    - Interview candidates
    - Business partners
    - Customer representatives
    - Auditors and inspectors

### Former Insiders

- **Ex-employees**: Previously authorized users who no longer require access
    
    - Recently terminated employees
    - Employees who transitioned to competitors
    - Retirees with historical knowledge
    - Seasonal workers between employment periods
- **Security Classification Challenges**:
    
    - May retain knowledge of internal systems and processes
    - Potential possession of credentials if improper offboarding occurred
    - Understanding of security controls and potential weaknesses
