[Historically, cybersecurity techniques relied on the identification of static known threats, such as viruses or rootkits, Trojans, botnets, and exploits for specific software vulnerabilities. It is relatively straightforward to identify and scan for these types of threats with automated software. Unfortunately, adversaries were able to develop means of circumventing this type of signature-based scanning.

The sophisticated nature of modern cybersecurity threats requires the creation of profiles of threat actor types and behaviors. This analysis involves identifying the attributes of threat actors, location, capability, resources/funding, and motivation.

## Internal/External

Internal/external refers to the degree of access that a threat actor possesses before initiating an attack.

- **External Threat Actor**: Has no account or authorized access to the target system. They infiltrate security systems using unauthorized access, such as hacking into a network.
  - **Note**: An external actor can perpetrate an attack remotely or on-premises.

- **Internal/Insider Threat Actor**: Has been granted permissions on the system, typically an employee, but can also arise from contractors or business partners.

## Level of Sophistication/Capability

Level of sophistication/capability refers to a threat actor's ability to use advanced exploit techniques and tools.

- **Least Capable**: Relies on commodity attack tools widely available.
- **More Capable**: Able to create new exploits in operating systems, applications, and embedded systems.
- **Most Capable**: Uses non-cyber tools such as political or military assets.

## Resources/Funding

Sophisticated threat actor groups require substantial resources and funding.

- Capable groups need customized attack tools, skilled strategists, designers, coders, hackers, and social engineers.
- The most capable groups receive funding from **nation-states** or **organized crime**.

These traditional methods were effective in detecting and stopping attacks that matched pre-defined signatures. However, as adversaries have become more sophisticated, they have developed methods to bypass these signature-based systems, leading to the need for more advanced threat analysis approaches.

To stay ahead of evolving threats, modern cybersecurity strategies focus on profiling threat actors by their characteristics, including their **internal/external** access, **sophistication/capability**, **resources/funding**, and **motivation**. Understanding these attributes allows cybersecurity professionals to assess the level of threat and prepare more targeted defensive measures.

## Internal/External Threat Actors

### **External Threat Actors**
An external threat actor is someone who does not have authorized access to the target system before launching an attack. They must break through the system's defenses to gain access, typically through methods such as:

- **Hacking into a network**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in software or using brute-force methods to gain access.
- **Social engineering**: Manipulating people to gain unauthorized access, often through phishing, pretexting, or baiting.
- **Physical infiltration**: Gaining unauthorized access to physical premises (e.g., stealing devices or bypassing physical security).

External actors can launch attacks both remotely (e.g., over the internet) and on-premises (e.g., infiltrating a corporate building).

### **Internal/Insider Threat Actors**
Internal threat actors have already been granted access to the system. These actors are typically employees but can also include contractors, business partners, or anyone with trusted access. Internal threats are harder to detect, as the actor may already have legitimate credentials or permissions to perform actions on the system.

Types of internal threats include:
- **Disgruntled employees**: Employees who intentionally or unintentionally misuse their access to the system, often due to personal grievances or malicious intent.
- **Accidental insiders**: Employees who unknowingly introduce threats, such as clicking on a phishing email or mishandling sensitive data.
- **Compromised insiders**: External actors who steal or compromise insider credentials to gain access.

## Level of Sophistication/Capability

### **Low Capability**
At this level, threat actors typically rely on publicly available tools and exploits. They may use automated attack software or pre-configured malware that is readily accessible. These actors often have minimal technical skills and can cause harm through well-known vulnerabilities but lack the expertise to create new, advanced threats.

- **Tools**: Malware downloaded from the internet, exploit kits, basic botnets.
- **Targeting**: Low-level vulnerabilities and easily exploited weaknesses, such as outdated software or simple configuration flaws.

### **Moderate Capability**
Actors with moderate capability can identify new vulnerabilities and modify existing tools or scripts to better suit their goals. These actors might use sophisticated malware that they customize for specific targets. They may possess basic to intermediate knowledge of networking, security, and software development.

- **Tools**: Custom malware, more advanced phishing techniques, social engineering.
- **Targeting**: Specific businesses or individuals, leveraging zero-day exploits or vulnerabilities that have not yet been publicly disclosed.

### **High Capability**
Highly sophisticated actors are capable of creating their own malware, identifying novel vulnerabilities, and designing highly complex attacks that require deep technical knowledge and expertise. These actors can often bypass traditional detection methods and engage in more stealthy, persistent attacks.

- **Tools**: Custom exploits, rootkits, advanced malware, targeted cyber-espionage tools.
- **Targeting**: High-profile targets, such as large corporations, government agencies, and critical infrastructure.

### **Elite Capability**
Elite threat actors have access to significant resources and expertise, allowing them to develop and deploy cyber-attacks that involve advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). They may use tools from nation-state-level cyber operations or deploy cyber-warfare techniques. These actors often blend cyber and non-cyber strategies to achieve political, military, or economic goals.

- **Tools**: State-sponsored malware, cyber-warfare tools, advanced exploitation techniques.
- **Targeting**: High-value targets such as national security agencies, large multinational corporations, and critical infrastructure systems.

## Resources/Funding

The level of sophistication in a threat actor is often directly related to the resources and funding available to them. Sophisticated cyber-attacks require significant investments in both human capital and technological infrastructure. The more resources a threat actor has access to, the more capable and persistent their attacks will be.

### **Low Resources/Funding**
Low-resourced actors may use free or low-cost tools and techniques, typically relying on commodity malware and readily available exploits. These attackers often lack access to specialized tools or a large team, limiting the scale of their operations.

- **Funding Source**: Personal or small-scale operations, often driven by financial motivation (e.g., stealing credit card data).
- **Tools**: Free hacking tools, basic malware kits, phishing tools.

### **Moderate Resources/Funding**
Actors with moderate funding may have access to a wider range of tools, including custom exploits and some degree of technical support (e.g., hired hackers or consultants). These actors can launch more targeted attacks but are still constrained in terms of the scale and complexity of their operations.

- **Funding Source**: Organized crime, cyber-criminal groups, private individuals with a financial stake.
- **Tools**: Customized malware, botnets, and exploit kits.

### **High Resources/Funding**
At this level, threat actors are often funded by nation-states, organized crime syndicates, or multinational corporations. They have access to highly skilled teams of hackers, social engineers, and strategists, as well as advanced attack infrastructure.

- **Funding Source**: Nation-states, organized crime groups, large-scale corporate espionage operations.
- **Tools**: Advanced, customized attack tools, zero-day exploits, sophisticated malware, and cyber-espionage techniques.
