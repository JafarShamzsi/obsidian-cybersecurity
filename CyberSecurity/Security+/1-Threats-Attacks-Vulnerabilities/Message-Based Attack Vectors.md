## **Email Security Threats**

Email, a foundational tool for digital communication, remains a persistent target for malicious activities. A multitude of attack types leverage email to compromise systems, steal data, and inflict financial harm.

### **Types of Email Attacks**

- <span style="background:#fff88f">Phishing</span>: Phishing, a deceptive form of cyberattack, involves sending fraudulent emails disguised as legitimate communications from trusted sources.1 These emails often employ social engineering tactics to manipulate recipients into divulging sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details.3 Attackers frequently use spoofed email addresses and domains to appear as credible senders.6 A common method involves embedding malicious links within the email that redirect unsuspecting users to fake websites meticulously designed to mimic legitimate login pages, thereby stealing credentials or installing malware on the victim's device.4 Additionally, malicious files containing various forms of malware are often attached to these deceptive emails.4
    
    Notable instances of phishing attacks underscore their potential for widespread damage. A phishing campaign targeting Google and Facebook between 2013 and 2015 resulted in a staggering financial loss for both companies.12 The 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, which disrupted a significant portion of the U.S. East Coast's oil supply, is believed to have originated from a phishing email, highlighting the severe consequences for critical infrastructure.12 In 2020, a phishing attack on Elara Caring, a healthcare provider, compromised the personal information of over 100,000 elderly patients.12 Similarly, a smishing (SMS phishing) campaign in 2020 used the United States Post Office (USPS) as a front to steal Google account credentials.12 More recently, in 2023, a Microsoft cloud email breach compromised numerous government agencies, demonstrating the ongoing threat to even well-protected entities.3 The increasing sophistication of these attacks, with the use of realistic website clones and the exploitation of trusted brands, necessitates heightened user awareness regarding the authenticity of email communications. The observed shift towards smishing tactics also indicates an adaptation by attackers to the prevalent use of mobile communication.12 Attackers are strategically following user activity, recognizing the increased reliance on mobile devices and the potential for SMS to be perceived as a more trustworthy communication channel than email. The success of impersonating well-known brands underscores the critical need for user education that emphasizes verifying sender authenticity through multiple means, extending beyond simply relying on the displayed name in an email or message.14
    
- <span style="background:#fff88f">Spear Phishing</span>: Spear phishing represents a more focused and personalized form of phishing, targeting specific individuals or organizations rather than broad groups.7 Attackers meticulously gather information about their intended targets from publicly available sources, such as social media platforms and company websites, to craft highly tailored and convincing messages.17 These messages often impersonate trusted individuals within the target's network, such as colleagues or superiors, to enhance their credibility.4 Spear phishing attacks frequently involve the use of fake invoices or urgent requests for financial transactions, leveraging the target's professional responsibilities and trust in established protocols.18
    
    Several high-profile incidents illustrate the effectiveness of spear phishing. In 2015, Ubiquiti Networks fell victim to a Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack initiated through carefully crafted spear phishing emails.3 The notorious 2014 hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment also employed spear phishing emails to gain initial access to the company's network.21 Furthermore, a spear phishing email was the entry point for the 2011 breach of RSA Security, which compromised their SecurID two-factor authentication system.21 The success of spear phishing lies in its personalized approach, exploiting the target's trust in known contacts or organizations and leveraging specific details to appear legitimate. The financial sector is often a prime target for these attacks due to the potential for significant financial gains through fraudulent transactions or access to sensitive financial data.17 Attackers invest considerable time in reconnaissance, meticulously researching their targets to ensure their pretexts are believable and their requests align with typical communication patterns. By targeting individuals with financial authority or access to sensitive information, attackers aim to maximize the potential payoff from a successful compromise.
    
- **<span style="background:#fff88f">Business Email Compromise (BEC)</span>**: Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated and financially motivated scam where cybercriminals impersonate trusted leaders within an organization to deceive employees into sending money or sensitive data to unauthorized entities.4 These attacks often involve various methods, including CEO fraud, where attackers impersonate high-level executives like the CEO to request urgent wire transfers, often under the guise of confidential matters.20 Another common tactic is account compromise, where attackers gain access to an employee's email account and use it to send fraudulent payment requests to vendors or other employees.20 Attorney impersonation is also employed, with criminals posing as legal representatives to pressure employees into making hasty financial transactions.20 Additionally, fake invoice schemes are prevalent, where attackers spoof vendor invoices or create entirely bogus ones, directing payments to fraudulent accounts controlled by the cybercriminals.4
    
    The financial impact of BEC attacks can be substantial, as evidenced by several prominent cases. Ubiquiti Networks suffered significant financial losses in a BEC scam 3, and Toyota Boshoku Corporation also lost a considerable amount of money due to a similar attack.4 Crelan Bank experienced substantial financial damage as a result of a business email compromise 12, and even technology giants like Facebook and Google were victims of a BEC attack involving fake invoices.12 BEC attacks are particularly devastating due to their reliance on social engineering and the exploitation of trust within organizational hierarchies. The average cost of a successful BEC attack is notably high.25 Attackers meticulously exploit the inherent trust that exists between employees and their leadership, often leveraging the perceived authority of senior figures to compel action. The primary motivation behind these attacks is typically financial gain, with requests often involving wire transfers or the payment of fraudulent invoices. The increasing use of artificial intelligence to enhance impersonation capabilities makes these attacks even more challenging to detect, as the crafted emails can closely mimic the writing style and tone of the individuals being impersonated.6
    
- **<span style="background:#fff88f">Malware Attacks via Email</span>**: Email remains a significant vector for the distribution of malware, with attackers sending emails containing malicious attachments or embedded links designed to install harmful software on the recipient's device.4 These attacks employ various methods to trick users into interacting with the malicious content. Executable files (.exe), Microsoft Office documents containing malicious macros, Portable Document Format (PDF) files with embedded scripts, and archive files (e.g.,.zip,.rar) that conceal malware are commonly used as attachments.10 Attackers also embed malicious links within the body of emails that, when clicked, initiate the download and installation of malware.9
    
    Several notable malware attacks have leveraged email as a primary distribution method. The WannaCry ransomware, which caused widespread disruption globally, often spread through malicious email attachments.9 Similarly, the Petya ransomware frequently utilized emails containing fake job applications as a delivery mechanism.10 The Maze and REvil ransomware groups have also been observed employing malicious email attachments to propagate their ransomware.10 Email's continued role as a primary malware delivery vector highlights the persistent efforts of attackers to adapt their tactics and file types to evade security measures. The increasing prevalence of ransomware, often delivered via email, underscores the potential for significant operational disruption and substantial financial losses for affected organizations.10 Users are often more inclined to open familiar file types, such as Office documents and PDFs, making them effective carriers for concealed malware.29 The ongoing evolution of ransomware demonstrates the increasing sophistication of malicious payloads delivered through email, with attackers employing advanced techniques to encrypt data and demand ransom payments.10 The challenge of detecting zero-day exploits, which target previously unknown vulnerabilities, further emphasizes the critical need for layered security defences and proactive threat intelligence.30
    
- **<span style="background:#fff88f">Spam</span>**: Spam, also known as junk mail, refers to unsolicited and unwanted email messages sent in bulk to a large number of recipients.4 While the primary purpose of spam is often advertising, it can also serve as a vehicle for distributing harmful content, including links to phishing websites or malicious attachments.9 Attackers leverage the low cost of sending mass emails to reach a wide audience, hoping that even a small percentage of recipients will interact with the malicious content.4 While often considered a mere nuisance, spam poses a legitimate security risk by potentially leading users to more serious threats like phishing and malware.9 The sheer volume of spam generated daily necessitates the implementation of effective spam filtering mechanisms to reduce the attack surface and minimize the risk of users inadvertently engaging with harmful emails.4
    

### **Methods and Techniques in Email Attacks**

Email attacks employ a range of methods and techniques to achieve their malicious objectives. Social engineering remains a cornerstone, involving the manipulation of individuals through psychological tactics to gain access to sensitive information or systems.3 Domain spoofing, where attackers forge the sender's email address to appear as a legitimate source, is a common technique used in phishing and BEC attacks.6 Malicious attachments, embedding harmful software within files attached to emails, are a frequent method for distributing malware.4 Similarly, malicious links embedded in emails redirect users to phishing websites or initiate the download of malware.2 Attackers have also evolved their techniques to include conversation hijacking, where they insert themselves into existing email threads to appear as a legitimate participant and gain the trust of the other parties involved.6 Furthermore, the increasing sophistication of attacks is evident in the use of AI-based phishing, where generative artificial intelligence tools are employed to craft more convincing and personalized phishing emails that are harder for targets to detect.6

**<span style="background:#fff88f">Email Security Best Practices and Prevention</span>**

Combating email security threats requires a multi-faceted approach encompassing technical controls, user education, and established policies. Employee awareness training is crucial, educating users to recognize the telltale signs of phishing attempts and other email-borne threats.12 Organizations should deploy robust email security solutions, including advanced spam filters, anti-phishing tools, and malware detection systems, to automatically identify and block malicious emails before they reach users' inboxes.12 Implementing email security protocols such as Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) is essential for authenticating email senders and preventing domain spoofing, thereby reducing the effectiveness of phishing attacks.14 Enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an additional layer of security to email accounts, making it significantly harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access even if they obtain a user's password.4 Keeping email clients and operating systems regularly updated with the latest security patches is vital to address known vulnerabilities that attackers often exploit.11 When users receive suspicious emails, they should be trained to verify their legitimacy by contacting the purported senders through alternative, trusted communication channels.14 Finally, implementing data loss prevention (DLP) solutions can help prevent sensitive information from being inadvertently or maliciously sent via email, adding another layer of defense against data exfiltration.35

<span style="background:#fff88f">SMS Security Threats</span>
Short Message Service (SMS), while a convenient communication method, is also susceptible to various security threats that can compromise personal and organizational data.

- **<span style="background:#fff88f">Smishing (SMS Phishing)</span>**: Smishing, a portmanteau of "SMS" and "phishing," refers to phishing attacks carried out via SMS text messages on mobile phones.7 These attacks often involve sending fraudulent messages that impersonate trusted organizations, such as banks, delivery services, or government agencies, to deceive recipients into revealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or financial details.7 Smishing messages frequently include malicious links that, when clicked, redirect users to fake websites designed to steal their credentials or install malware on their devices.15 Attackers often employ social engineering tactics within these messages to create a sense of urgency, fear, or excitement, compelling victims to act quickly without scrutinizing the message's authenticity.7
    
    Several examples illustrate the prevalence of smishing attacks. A smishing campaign in 2020 impersonated the USPS to steal Google account credentials.12 Smishing attacks commonly impersonate banks, alerting users to supposed suspicious activity and prompting them to log in via a malicious link, or delivery companies, claiming package delivery issues and requesting personal information or payment.38 Following a data breach at UPS Canada, a smishing campaign targeted customers with fraudulent messages about package delivery fees.39 Smishing tactics often exploit the immediacy and trust associated with text messages, as users may be more inclined to believe and act upon SMS messages compared to emails. The personal nature of mobile phones and the expectation of receiving legitimate notifications via SMS can lower users' defenses against these types of attacks. The limited screen space on mobile devices can also make it more difficult to discern malicious links or spoofed sender information, contributing to the effectiveness of smishing campaigns.40
    
- **<span style="background:#fff88f">Exploitation of SS7 Vulnerabilities</span>**: Signaling System 7 (SS7) is a suite of signaling protocols used in telecommunication networks to facilitate various functions, including call setup, SMS messaging, and roaming.41 Designed decades ago, SS7 has inherent security weaknesses due to its original architecture, which lacked robust authentication and encryption mechanisms.41 Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to perform a range of malicious activities, including intercepting SMS messages, even those containing critical two-factor authentication (2FA) codes used to secure online accounts.41 They can also track the real-time location of mobile phone users by exploiting SS7's routing functionalities.44 Furthermore, attackers can reroute calls and SMS messages through their own servers, allowing them to eavesdrop on conversations and intercept sensitive information without the user's knowledge.44
    
    Real-world incidents have demonstrated the potential impact of SS7 exploitation. In 2017, attackers leveraged SS7 flaws to intercept 2FA codes sent via SMS to German bank customers, enabling unauthorized withdrawals from their accounts.45 Security researchers have also documented instances of global surveillance activities conducted by exploiting SS7 vulnerabilities.45 In 2022, attackers exploited SS7 weaknesses to hijack SMS verification codes for cryptocurrency exchange accounts, leading to significant financial losses for the victims.46 The exploitation of SS7 highlights vulnerabilities that exist at the core of telecommunication networks, often beyond the direct control or visibility of end-users. This underscores the importance of security measures at the infrastructure level to protect against such sophisticated attacks. While user education and endpoint security can mitigate some SMS-based threats like smishing, SS7 attacks operate on a different layer, intercepting communications by exploiting fundamental weaknesses in the signaling protocols themselves. This necessitates a collaborative approach involving telecommunication providers and cybersecurity experts to address these systemic vulnerabilities and enhance the security of mobile communications.43
    

**<span style="background:#fff88f">SMS Security Best Practices and Prevention</span>**

Preventing SMS security threats requires a combination of technological solutions, organizational policies, and user awareness. Implementing mobile security policies, such as deploying Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions, can help secure company-owned devices from smishing attacks by enforcing measures like encryption and the use of secure apps.36 Organizations should also monitor and filter messaging services to block fraudulent and malicious SMS messages before they reach employees.36 Protecting company data and systems involves prohibiting employees from sharing confidential business information via SMS and limiting access to sensitive systems using strong security controls.36 Creating a culture of cybersecurity awareness through regular training can educate employees about the risks of smishing and other SMS-based threats.36 Encouraging vigilance against social engineering attacks by teaching users to recognize the warning signs in suspicious text messages is also crucial.36 Organizations should strengthen authentication measures and avoid relying solely on SMS-based multi-factor authentication due to its susceptibility to interception.36 Utilizing SMS filtering rules and installing anti-phishing and anti-smishing tools on mobile devices can provide an additional layer of protection by automatically flagging or blocking suspicious messages and links.49
