The unauthorized modification of a website’s appearance or content, typically to spread propaganda, misinformation, or political messages.

## External Threat Actor
A threat actor with no authorized access to the target system. They attempt to infiltrate security defenses via unauthorized methods such as hacking, social engineering, or physical infiltration. External actors are often the focus of firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

## Internal/Insider Threat Actor
A threat actor with authorized access to the target system. This access may be legitimate, such as that of an employee, or it may be granted to contractors or business partners. Insider threats are often harder to detect because the actor already has trusted access to sensitive systems.

## Chaotic Motivations
Threat actors motivated by the desire to cause disruption, often without any clear or specific goal other than spreading chaos. These actors might engage in defacement, spreading malware, or creating disruption in services.

## Financial Motivation
Motivations driven by a desire for monetary gain. This includes blackmail, extortion, and fraud, where the threat actor targets assets or data to generate profit.

## Political Motivation
Threat actors who are motivated by political, ideological, or activist reasons. These can include whistleblowing, activism, espionage, or nation-state-sponsored attacks.

## Blackmail
The act of demanding payment in exchange for not releasing sensitive or damaging information. Blackmail can occur when an attacker threatens to expose private data or create false narratives unless the victim complies.

## Extortion
Demands for payment to prevent or halt an ongoing attack. Extortion typically involves the use of malware or other malicious tactics to block access to systems or steal sensitive data.

## Commercial Espionage
The act of stealing trade secrets, intellectual property, or proprietary information from a competitor. This is typically carried out by individuals or organizations looking to gain a market advantage.

## Service Disruption
Attacks designed to compromise the availability of systems or services, leading to operational disruption. Service disruption can be a goal in itself or used as a tactic to distract from other attacks.

## Data Exfiltration
The unauthorized transfer or theft of data from an organization's systems. It often involves stealing sensitive or confidential information, which can be used for financial gain, blackmail, or espionage.

## Disinformation
The deliberate spreading of false information with the intent to deceive. This can be done through social media, news outlets, or even by altering legitimate websites to spread a particular narrative.

## Espionage
The act of spying or stealing sensitive data, typically for political, military, or economic purposes. Espionage can be carried out by nation-states, corporate entities, or individuals.

## Level of Sophistication/Capability
A measure of how advanced and capable a threat actor is in using various cyber tools and techniques. Low-level actors use widely available tools, while highly capable actors develop custom exploits and attack strategies, often using advanced malware and novel vulnerabilities.

## Resources/Funding
The financial and technical resources available to a threat actor. High-resource actors have the ability to hire skilled professionals, develop custom attack tools, and deploy large-scale campaigns. Nation-states and criminal organizations often fund the most sophisticated attackers.

## Nation-State Actor
A threat actor sponsored or controlled by a government. Nation-state actors are typically well-funded and have access to advanced resources, making them among the most sophisticated attackers.

## Cyber-Espionage
The practice of using cyber-attacks to gather intelligence from a target, typically for political or economic advantage. Nation-state actors or corporate competitors are often involved in cyber-espionage.

### **Authentication**  
The process of verifying a subject’s identity before granting access to a system or resource. Authentication follows **identification** and precedes **authorization** in the AAA model.  

### **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
A security process that requires two or more authentication factors (e.g., password + OTP) to verify identity.  

### **OAuth 2.0**  
An open standard for authentication and authorization, commonly used for web applications and APIs.  

### **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**  
A standard used for federated authentication and Single Sign-On (SSO) in enterprises.  

### **Brute Force Attack**  
An attack where an attacker tries multiple passwords or credential combinations to gain access.  

### **Authorization**  
The process of determining what resources a user, system, or process can access after authentication. Authorization follows **identification** and **authentication** in the AAA model.  

### **Access Control List (ACL)**  
A list defining which subjects have what permissions on an object, used in both file systems and network security.  

### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
An authorization model where access is assigned based on roles rather than individual users, improving scalability and security.  

### **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**  
An authorization model where access is granted based on attributes like location, device, or time of access, allowing for more dynamic security policies.

### **Preventive Control**
A security measure that prevents security incidents before they occur.

### **Detective Control**
A security measure that identifies and records security incidents as they happen.

### **Corrective Control**
A security measure that reduces damage and restores systems after an attack.

### **Directive Control**
A security control that enforces rules, best practices, or policies.

### **Deterrent Control**

### Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)

A stealthy threat actor, typically a nation-state or state-sponsored group, that gains unauthorized access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period.

### Buffer Overflow

A condition where a program attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of pre-allocated memory, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

A type of injection attack where malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites, which are then executed by the victim's browser.

## Governance & Risk Management

### Gap Analysis

A methodical process that compares an organization's current security posture against a selected framework or standard to identify missing controls, assess risks, and develop remediation plans. Used to guide security investments and ensure compliance with industry standards. [[Gap Analysis]]

## Security Fundamentals

### CIA Triad

The cornerstone model of information security that defines the three primary goals of any security program: Confidentiality (information is only accessible to authorized users), Integrity (data remains accurate and unaltered without authorization), and Availability (information is accessible when needed by authorized users). Sometimes referred to as AIC to avoid confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency. [[CIA Triad]]

### Confidentiality

A property of secure information meaning that data can only be accessed by authorized individuals. Protects against unauthorized disclosure of information.

### Integrity

A property of secure information meaning that data remains in its intended state and any modifications are authorized through proper channels. Ensures data has not been tampered with.

### Availability

A property of secure information meaning that systems and data are accessible when needed by authorized users.

### Non-repudiation

The inability to deny having performed an action. Ensures that a subject cannot deny their actions, providing accountability in systems through evidence of identity and actions.

## Additional Terms

### Air Gap

A security measure that involves physically isolating a computer or network from unsecured networks, such as the public internet.

### Blue Team

Security professionals who defend against security breaches and threats.

### Zero-Day Vulnerability
