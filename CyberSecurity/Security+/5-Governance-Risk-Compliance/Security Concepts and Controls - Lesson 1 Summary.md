## Overview

This lesson focuses on comparing and contrasting security controls using different categories and functional types, and explains how security concepts and frameworks are used to develop and validate security policies and control selection. Understanding these foundational concepts is critical for implementing effective organizational security.

## Key Guidelines for Security Controls and Frameworks

- **Security Mission Statement**: Create a security mission statement and supporting policies that emphasize the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, availability).
- **Role Assignment**: Clearly define security tasks and responsibilities so that security impacts are assessed and mitigated across the organization.
- **Security Functions**: Consider establishing dedicated business units to support security functions:
    - Security Operations Center (SOC)
    - Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT)
    - DevSecOps integration
- **Compliance Requirements**: Identify and assess laws and industry regulations that impose compliance requirements on your business.
- **Framework Selection**: Choose a security framework that meets your organization's compliance requirements and business needs.
- **Security Controls Matrix**: Create a matrix of existing security controls to identify categories and functions, then consider deploying additional controls for any gaps in capabilities.
- **Gap Analysis**: Evaluate security capabilities against framework requirements to identify goals for developing additional cybersecurity competencies and improving information security assurance.

## Real-World Applications

- A financial institution might use these guidelines to implement PCI DSS compliance controls
- Healthcare organizations apply these concepts to meet HIPAA security requirements
- Government contractors follow these steps to demonstrate compliance with NIST frameworks
- Small businesses can use these guidelines to create a right-sized security approach without overextending resources

## Exam Tips

- Know the relationship between the CIA triad and security policies
- Understand the difference between control categories (physical, technical, administrative) and control functions (preventive, detective, corrective)
- Be able to explain how gap analysis helps improve security posture
- Remember that framework selection should be based on both compliance requirements AND business needs
- Recognize that security responsibilities must be assigned across the organization, not just to IT staff
