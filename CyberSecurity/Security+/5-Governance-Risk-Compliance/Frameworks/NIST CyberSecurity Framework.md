## Overview

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) provides a set of guidelines for organizations to improve their cybersecurity posture. It organizes cybersecurity tasks into five core functions that provide a strategic view of the lifecycle of an organization's security risk management.

## The Five Functions

### 1. Identify

- Develop security policies and capabilities
- Evaluate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities
- Recommend security controls to mitigate identified risks
- Create asset inventories and data classification
- Establish governance processes

### 2. Protect

- Procure, develop, install, operate, and decommission IT hardware and software with security embedded at every stage
- Implement access controls
- Deploy security awareness training
- Establish data security measures
- Use protective technologies
- Implement maintenance procedures

### 3. Detect

- Perform ongoing, proactive monitoring
- Ensure that controls remain effective
- Adapt to protect against new types of threats
- Deploy anomaly detection systems
- Implement continuous monitoring solutions
- Conduct regular vulnerability scans

### 4. Respond

- Identify, analyze, contain, and eradicate threats
- Create incident response plans
- Establish communication procedures
- Develop analysis techniques
- Deploy mitigation strategies
- Implement improvement processes

### 5. Recover

- Implement cybersecurity resilience
- Restore systems and data after incidents
- Develop recovery plans
- Create improvement processes
- Establish communication strategies
- Manage public relations and reputation

## Security+ Exam Relevance

- Domain 5: Governance, Risk, and Compliance
- Important framework for understanding how security programs are organized
- Provides structure for approaching security challenges and planning

## Examples

- **Identify**: Conducting a risk assessment to discover vulnerabilities in a network
- **Protect**: Implementing multi-factor authentication to secure access to critical systems
- **Detect**: Deploying an intrusion detection system to monitor for suspicious activity
- **Respond**: Creating an incident response playbook for handling ransomware attacks
- **Recover**: Developing and testing backup restoration procedures to recover from data loss
