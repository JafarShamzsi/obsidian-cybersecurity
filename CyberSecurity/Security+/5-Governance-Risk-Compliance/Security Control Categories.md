## Overview
Security controls are measures implemented to protect systems, data, and operations from threats. They ensure the **CIA triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) and **non-repudiation** are upheld. Organizations use security controls within risk management frameworks to maintain cybersecurity assurance.

## Categories of Security Controls
Security controls are classified based on how they are implemented:

### **1. Managerial Controls**
- Provide oversight of the information system.
- Used for risk management and security assessment.
- **Examples:**
  - Risk identification and analysis tools
  - Security policy frameworks
  - Compliance audits

### **2. Operational Controls**
- Implemented primarily by people rather than technology.
- Ensure day-to-day security procedures and awareness.
- **Examples:**
  - Security awareness training programs
  - Incident response plans
  - Physical security guards

### **3. Technical Controls**
- Implemented through hardware, software, or firmware.
- Protect systems and networks from cyber threats.
- **Examples:**
  - Firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
  - Antivirus and endpoint protection
  - OS-based access control mechanisms

### **4. Physical Controls**
- Focus on preventing unauthorized access to physical locations and hardware.
- **Examples:**
  - Security cameras and alarms
  - Biometric authentication systems
  - Locks, fencing, and lighting

## NIST Classification of Security Controls
The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** uses a different classification scheme for security controls. Refer to the latest version of **NIST Special Publication 800-53** for detailed categorization. ([NIST SP 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final))

## Real-World Application
- **Example 1**: A financial company implements **managerial controls** by conducting regular security audits to ensure compliance with regulations.
- **Example 2**: A corporate office uses **physical controls** such as access badges, biometric scanners, and security guards to prevent unauthorized entry.
- **Example 3**: A healthcare provider implements **technical controls** like encryption and firewalls to protect patient records from cyber threats.

## Exam Tips
- Be familiar with the four categories of security controls.
- Understand the difference between **technical** and **physical** controls.
- Know how **managerial** and **operational** controls contribute to risk management.
- Be aware of **NISTâ€™s** classification and its relevance to security policies.

   - D. To monitor employee behavior through security cameras  
   - **Answer**: B. Managerial controls focus on risk management and oversight.
