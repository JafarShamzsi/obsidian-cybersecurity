## Overview

Gap analysis is a systematic process that identifies how an organization's security systems deviate from those required or recommended by a cybersecurity framework. It evaluates the current security posture against desired or required states to identify gaps that need to be addressed.

## Key Points

- Performed when adopting a framework or meeting new compliance requirements
- May be repeated periodically (every few years) to validate changes or maintain compliance
- Helps organizations prioritize security investments
- Provides objective measurement of security capabilities
- Often involves third-party consultants for expertise and objectivity

## Process Components

### 1. Framework Selection

- Choose appropriate framework(s) based on industry, regulations, and business needs
- Examples: NIST CSF, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, COBIT

### 2. Current State Assessment

- Inventory existing security controls and capabilities
- Document current configuration and implementation details
- Evaluate effectiveness of existing controls

### 3. Gap Identification

- Compare current state to framework requirements
- Score each section based on compliance/capability level
- Identify missing or poorly configured controls

### 4. Risk Assessment

- Evaluate impact of identified gaps on CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Prioritize gaps based on risk level
- Assign risk scores to each area

### 5. Remediation Planning

- Develop recommendations to address identified gaps
- Establish target remediation dates/quarters
- Prioritize actions based on risk scores and business impact

## Gap Analysis Report Structure

For each section of the framework, a gap analysis report typically includes:

- Overall score or capability level
- Detailed list of missing or poorly configured controls
- Risk assessment (often using CIA Triad as a framework)
- Recommendations for remediation
- Target remediation timeframes

## Example Gap Analysis Table

|Function|Controls (Actual/Required)|Capability Level|CIA Triad Risk Levels|Target Remediation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Identify** (10/16)||Intermediate|||
|Asset Management|4/6|Intermediate|C:6, I:6, A:6|Q4|
|Governance|3/4|Intermediate|C:6, I:6, A:1|Q3|
|Risk Assessment|3/6|No/Basic|C:6, I:6, A:3|Q3|
|**Protect** (8/16)||No/Basic|||
|Identity and Access Management|5/8|Intermediate|C:9, I:9, A:4|Q1|
|Data Security|3/8|No/Basic|C:9, I:9, A:4|Q1|

## Security+ Exam Relevance

- Domain 5: Governance, Risk, and Compliance
- Understanding gap analysis is important for evaluating organizational security posture
- Demonstrates knowledge of how to implement frameworks in real-world scenarios

## Examples

- A healthcare organization conducting a gap analysis against HIPAA requirements
- A financial institution evaluating its controls against PCI DSS standards
- A government contractor assessing compliance with NIST 800-53 controls
