## Overview

**Passwordless authentication** represents a paradigm shift in identity verification by eliminating the traditional knowledge-based factor (password) entirely. Instead of using "something you know," this approach relies primarily on "something you have" (authenticator) combined with "something you are" (biometrics) or a local PIN.

## Core Principles

- **Elimination of traditional passwords** from the authentication process
- **Reliance on cryptographic keys** rather than shared secrets
- **Local verification** of user presence and intent
- **Decentralized credentials** specific to each service (relying party)

## FIDO2 and WebAuthn Framework

![[FIDO2 WebAuthn Framework]] The FIDO2 standard with WebAuthn API provides the dominant framework for implementing passwordless authentication:

### Key Components

- **WebAuthn**: W3C standard web API that allows websites to register and authenticate users using public key cryptography
- **CTAP** (Client to Authenticator Protocol): Enables communication between the client platform and external authenticators
- **Authenticators**: Either platform-based or roaming (cross-platform)

## Authentication Flow

### Registration Process

1. User chooses an authenticator type:
    - **Roaming authenticator**: Security key (YubiKey, Titan Security Key)
    - **Platform authenticator**: Built into device (Windows Hello, Apple Touch ID/Face ID)
2. User configures a local gesture to confirm presence:
    - Biometric verification (fingerprint, facial recognition)
    - PIN entry
    - Physical touch/button press
3. User initiates registration with a relying party (website/service)
4. Authenticator generates a unique public/private key pair specifically for that service
5. Public key is sent to and stored by the relying party, associated with the user's account
6. Private key remains securely stored within the authenticator, never leaves the device

### Authentication Process

1. User visits the relying party website/application
2. Relying party issues an authentication challenge
3. Browser passes challenge to the authenticator
4. User performs the local gesture to unlock the authenticator
5. Authenticator signs the challenge with the private key specific to that relying party
6. Signed response sent to relying party
7. Relying party verifies signature using the stored public key
8. Authentication succeeds if signature is valid

## Security Mechanisms

### Attestation

- **Definition**: Process by which an authenticator proves it is a legitimate, trusted device
- **Implementation**:
    - Each authenticator is manufactured with an attestation key and model ID
    - During registration, the authenticator can provide an attestation certificate
    - Relying party can verify the attestation to confirm the authenticator is from a trusted manufacturer
- **Privacy considerations**:
    - Attestation keys identify only brand/model, not individual devices
    - Prevents tracking across services while maintaining security assurances

### Anti-Spoofing Measures

- **Origin binding**: Credentials are bound to specific origins (domains)
- **Challenge-response protocol**: Prevents replay attacks
- **User verification**: Local biometric or PIN verification
- **Authenticator tamper resistance**: Physical and logical protections

## Types of Authenticators

### Platform Authenticators

- **Built into the device/operating system**
- **Examples**:
    - Windows Hello (facial recognition, fingerprint, PIN)
    - Apple Touch ID/Face ID
    - Android biometric systems
- **Advantages**:
    - Seamless user experience
    - No additional hardware required
    - Often uses specialized secure hardware (TPM, Secure Enclave)
- **Limitations**:
    - Tied to specific device
    - May require device replacement if hardware fails

### Roaming Authenticators

- **Portable hardware that works across devices**
- **Examples**:
    - YubiKey
    - Google Titan Security Key
    - Feitian Security Keys
- **Types**:
    - USB
    - NFC
    - Bluetooth
- **Advantages**:
    - Cross-platform compatibility
    - Physical separation from the device being accessed
    - Highly portable
- **Limitations**:
    - Additional cost
    - Can be lost or damaged
    - Requires physical port or wireless capability

## Benefits Over Traditional Authentication

### Security Advantages

- **Elimination of password-related vulnerabilities**:
    - No password database to breach
    - No password reuse across services
    - Immune to phishing attacks (origin-bound credentials)
    - Resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks
    - No shared secrets transmitted during authentication
- **Resistance to remote attacks**:
    - Physical presence required (user verification)
    - Private keys never leave the authenticator
    - Each service has unique credentials

### User Experience Benefits

- **Reduced cognitive load** - no passwords to remember
- **Faster authentication** - single gesture vs typing complex password
- **Consistent experience** across services
- **Reduced friction** during account creation and login

### Administrative Advantages

- **Lower support costs** - fewer password resets
- **Reduced risk of credential stuffing attacks**
- **No password policy management required**
- **Simplified compliance** with security regulations

## Implementation Considerations

### Account Recovery

- **Critical challenge** for passwordless systems
- **Common approaches**:
    - Multiple registered authenticators
    - Backup codes
    - Administrator-assisted recovery
    - Out-of-band verification
- **Security vs. usability trade-offs**

### Migration Strategies

- **Gradual transition** from password + MFA to passwordless
- **Parallel authentication options** during transition
- **User education and adoption campaigns**
- **Phased rollout** by user group or application

### Enterprise Deployment

- **Directory service integration**
- **Authenticator lifecycle management**
- **Attestation requirements**
- **Recovery procedures**
- **Compliance documentation**

## Compatibility and Standards
