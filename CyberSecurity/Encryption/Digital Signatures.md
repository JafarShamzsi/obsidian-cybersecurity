## Cryptographic Foundation and Principles

Digital signatures represent one of the most powerful applications of asymmetric cryptography, providing a mechanism to verify both integrity and authenticity simultaneously. At their core, digital signatures combine hash functions and asymmetric cryptography to create a cryptographic binding between a message and its originator.

### Fundamental Security Properties

1. **Authentication**: Verifies the claimed identity of the message originator
    
    - Strong cryptographic proof of identity
    - Non-repudiation of origin
2. **Integrity**: Ensures the message has not been altered
    
    - Cryptographically bound to message content
    - Any modification invalidates the signature
3. **Non-repudiation**: Prevents the signer from denying participation
    
    - Legally binding in many jurisdictions
    - Evidential weight in court proceedings

## Signature Architecture and Components

Digital signature schemes consist of three primary algorithms:

### 1. Key Generation Algorithm

- Generates the asymmetric key pair (signing key and verification key)
- Ensures mathematical relationship between keys
- Secures the private key with appropriate controls

### 2. Signing Algorithm

- **Inputs**: Message, private key, and optional parameters
- **Process**:
    1. Compute message digest using cryptographic hash function
    2. Apply private key operation to the digest
    3. Format signature according to scheme specifications
- **Output**: Digital signature (and possibly metadata)

### 3. Verification Algorithm

- **Inputs**: Message, signature, public key, and optional parameters
- **Process**:
    1. Extract message digest from signature using public key
    2. Independently compute message digest
    3. Compare extracted and computed digests
- **Output**: Boolean verification result

## Major Digital Signature Algorithms
