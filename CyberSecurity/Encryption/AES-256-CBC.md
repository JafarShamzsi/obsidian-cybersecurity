have you ever been curious about how the US government stores its nuclear codes?

It could be on a document in an Oval Office vault with the warning “EXTREMELY TOP SECRET.” Who knows? Maybe it’s tattooed on the president’s—never mind.

One thing that’s certain is that government secrets and military-grade information are encrypted using a variety of encryption protocols—AES 256 being one of them.

And the best part about it is that AES 256 isn’t a privilege of the state alone; it’s a public software that you can use to reinforce your Data, OS and firmware integrity.
### 1. **What is AES-256-CBC?**

**AES-256-CBC** stands for **Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key in Cipher Block Chaining mode**. It is a **symmetric block cipher**, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** A standardized encryption algorithm adopted by NIST in 2001, originally based on the **Rijndael cipher** developed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.
    
- **256:** Refers to the key length — AES supports 128, 192, and 256-bit keys. AES-256 is the most secure variant.
    
- **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining):** An operation mode that introduces chaining and randomization by using an **Initialization Vector (IV)**.

### How Does the AES 256 Encryption Work?

To understand the intricacies of AES 256 encryption, you have to detour onto the operations of basic encryption protocols like the DES.

Encryption is an excellent option for [mitigating file sharing security risks](https://www.progress.com/blogs/file-sharing-security-risks-and-how-to-mitigate-them-with-managed-file-transfer-mft "File Sharing Security Risks and How to Mitigate Them"). It works by taking plain text or data and using a key to convert it into a code called a cipher. Cipher code is an unreadable and effectively indecipherable text that neither humans nor computers can understand.

With that out of the way, let’s delve into the complicated workings of AES 256 encryption. Hold your hats because this is where things get interesting. AES works in the following steps:

- **Divide Information Into Blocks**

The first step of AES 256 encryption is dividing the information into blocks. Because AES has a 128- bits block size, it divides the information into 4x4 columns of 16 bytes.

- **Key Expansion**

The next step of AES 256 encryption involves the AES algorithm recreating multiple round keys from the first key using Rijndael’s key schedule.

- **Adding the Round Key**

In round key addition, the AES algorithm adds the initial round key to the data that has been subdivided into 4x4 blocks.

- **Bite Substitution**

In this step, each byte of data is substituted with another byte of data.

- **Shifting Rows**

The AES algorithm then proceeds to shift rows of the 4x4 arrays. Bytes on the 2nd row are shifted one space to the left, those on the third are shifted two spaces, and so on.

- **Mixing Columns**

You’re still there. The AES algorithm uses a pre-established matrix to mix the 4x4 columns of the data array.

- **Another Round Key Addition**

The AES algorithm then repeats the second step, adding around key once again, then does this process all over again.

### AES 256 Uses Symmetric Keys

As you’ve seen, encryption uses a cryptographic key to turn your plain text and data into indecipherable and unreadable text.

Subsequently, it also uses a _similar_ key to decrypt your encrypted data into cipherable text. There are two types of keys in encryption, these are:

- Symmetric keys.
- Asymmetric keys.

A [symmetric key](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ztpf/2020?topic=concepts-symmetric-cryptography "Symmetric Cryptography") is a type of encryption where you use the same key for encrypting and decrypting data.

On the other hand, asymmetric keys use different keys for encrypting and decrypting data. If you’re wondering which one of two is better, there isn’t—both have their uses.

AES 256 is symmetric-based encryption. Not just that, it’s the most capable symmetric encryption available today. Some of the benefits of using symmetric keys are:

- Has faster encryption speed.
- It is good for internal or organizational data.
- It is excellent for encrypting large volumes of data.
- Requires less computational power to run.

### 3. **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode**

In CBC mode:

- Plaintext is divided into **fixed-size blocks** (16 bytes for AES)
    
- Before encryption, **each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block**
    
- The **first block** is XORed with an **Initialization Vector (IV)**
    

#### Encryption Formula:

mathematica

CopyEdit

`C₀ = E(P₀ ⊕ IV, K) Cₙ = E(Pₙ ⊕ Cₙ₋₁, K)`

#### Decryption Formula:

mathematica

CopyEdit

`P₀ = D(C₀, K) ⊕ IV Pₙ = D(Cₙ, K) ⊕ Cₙ₋₁`

Where:

- `E()` = AES encryption
    
- `D()` = AES decryption
    
- `⊕` = XOR operation
    
- `K` = AES-256 key
    
- `Pₙ` = nth plaintext block
    
- `Cₙ` = nth ciphertext block

### 4. **Security Considerations**

- **Key Size:** 256-bit key provides extremely high brute-force resistance.
    
- **IV:** Must be **random** and **unique** per encryption session. It does **not need to be secret**, but **must not be reused**.
    
- **Padding:** Since AES only operates on fixed-size blocks, padding (e.g., PKCS#7) is used when plaintext is not a multiple of 16 bytes.
    
- **Integrity:** AES-CBC does **not provide authentication**. Without an HMAC (or similar MAC), it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks and ciphertext manipulation.

### 5. **Common Usage (e.g., OpenSSL)**

To encrypt a file with OpenSSL:

`openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in plaintext.txt -out encrypted.bin -K <hexkey> -iv <hexiv>`

To decrypt:

`openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in encrypted.bin -out decrypted.txt -K <hexkey> -iv <hexiv>`

- `-K`: Hex-encoded 256-bit key (64 hex characters)
    
- `-iv`: Hex-encoded IV (32 hex characters)
    

---

### 7. **Best Practices**

- **Always generate a new random IV** for every encryption session.
    
- **Use a strong Key Derivation Function (KDF)** like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt if the key is derived from a password.
    
- **Use AES-CBC in conjunction with a MAC (e.g., HMAC-SHA256)** to ensure message integrity and prevent tampering.
    
- **Zero out keys from memory** after use (especially in C/C++).

### 8. **Alternatives**

- **AES-GCM**: Offers both encryption and authentication (preferred over CBC in modern applications).
    
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305**: A stream cipher with built-in authentication, good for constrained devices.
