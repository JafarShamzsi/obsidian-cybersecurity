    - AES-256-GCM: ~1 GB/sec on modern CPUs without AES-NI
    - AES-256-GCM: ~5-10 GB/sec with AES-NI hardware acceleration

### Hybrid Cryptosystem Implementation

Modern encryption systems leverage both symmetric and asymmetric algorithms in hybrid architectures:

#### Key Hierarchy Design

1. **Key Types and Relationships**:
    
    - **Key Encryption Keys (KEKs)**:
        - Asymmetric key pairs (RSA, ECC)
        - Long-term keys with strong protection
        - Tied to user/system identity
        - Used exclusively for key management operations
    - **Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)**:
        - Symmetric keys (AES-256, ChaCha20)
        - Ephemeral or semi-persistent
        - Generated per file/object or storage volume
        - Used exclusively for data encryption operations
2. **Hierarchical Key Management**:
    
    ```
    User Authentication → KEK Access → DEK Decryption → Data Decryption
    ```
    

#### Technical Implementation Process

            ```
            {  "algorithm": "AES-256-GCM",  "encrypted_key": "<base64-encoded-encrypted-DEK>",  "key_id": "<KEK-identifier>",  "iv": "<base64-encoded-IV>"}
            ```
            
        - Stored alongside or within encrypted data container
        - Multiple wrapped copies for recovery scenarios
3. **Encryption Flow**:
    
    ```
    1. System generates random DEK for symmetric algorithm
    2. Data is encrypted using DEK
    3. DEK is encrypted using public key (KEK)
    4. Encrypted DEK stored with encrypted data
    5. Original DEK securely removed from memory
    ```
    
4. **Decryption Flow**:
    
    ```
    1. User authenticates to unlock private key (KEK)
    2. System loads encrypted DEK from metadata
    3. Private key decrypts DEK
    4. DEK decrypts data
    5. DEK kept in secure memory during session
    6. DEK securely wiped when access complete
    ```
