# Creating NPCs in Pygame


Creating NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in PyGame involves several steps, including setting up the NPC's appearance, movement, and behavior. Here’s a basic guide to help you get started:

1. **Create the NPC Class**: Start by defining a class for your NPC. This class will inherit from a GameObject or a similar class if you are using a library like PyGame AI. For example:
    
    ```
    class NPC(GameObject):
        def __init__(self, pos=(0, 0)):
            img = pygame.Surface((10, 10)).convert_alpha()
            img.fill((255, 255, 255, 0))
            pygame.draw.circle(img, RED, (5, 5), 5)
            super(NPC, self).__init__(img_surf=img, pos=pos, max_speed=25, max_accel=40, max_rotation=40, max_angular_accel=30)
            self.ai = NullSteering()
    ```
    
    This initializes the NPC with a red circle image and sets its movement parameters.9
    
2. **Implement Movement Logic**: To make the NPC move, you need to implement an `update` method that will handle the NPC's movement based on its AI logic. For example:
    
    ```
    def update(self, tick):
        steering = self.ai.get_steering()
        self.steer(steering, tick)
        self.rect.move_ip(self.velocity)
    ```
    
    This method calculates the steering output from the AI and applies it to the NPC's movement.9
    
3. **Add AI Behavior**: To make the NPC follow the player, you can use a simple AI algorithm. One common approach is to calculate the direction vector from the NPC to the player and normalize it to move the NPC towards the player:
    
    ```
    def move_towards_player(self, player):
        dx, dy = player.rect.x - self.rect.x, player.rect.y - self.rect.y
        dist = math.hypot(dx, dy)
        dx, dy = dx / dist, dy / dist
        self.rect.x += dx * self.speed
        self.rect.y += dy * self.speed
    ```
    
    This method calculates the direction vector and normalizes it to move the NPC towards the player.4
    
4. **Integrate into Game Loop**: Finally, you need to integrate the NPC into your game loop. This involves initializing the NPC, updating its position each frame, and rendering it on the screen:
    
    ```
    # Initialize NPC
    npc = NPC(pos=(screen_width // 4, screen_height // 2))
    
    # Game loop
    while True:
        # Update NPC
        npc.update(tick)
        
        # Render NPC
        screen.blit(npc.image, npc.rect)
    ```
    
    This ensures the NPC is updated and rendered each frame.29
