Web application penetration testing is the practice of simulating attacks on a system in an attempt to gain access to sensitive data, with the purpose of determining whether a system is secure. These attacks are performed either internally or externally on a system, and they help provide information about the target system, identify vulnerabilities within them, and uncover exploits that could actually compromise the system. It is an essential health check of a system that informs testers whether remediation and security measures are needed.

With NMAP we can get the **fingerprint** of a webserver.

```shell
sudo nmap -p 443,80 --script=http-enum <target>
```

And can discover most popular directories open on the server.
