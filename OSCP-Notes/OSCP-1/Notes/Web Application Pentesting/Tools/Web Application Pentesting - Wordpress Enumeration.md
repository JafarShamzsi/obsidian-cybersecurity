## Wordpress enumeration

We can enumerate WordPress pages and their plugins and themes withÂ [wpscan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan). The following bash line will instruct wpscan to enumerate plugins in aggressive mode and print the output on a file

```shell

wpscan --url https://<TARGET> --enumerate p --plugins-detection aggressive -o dir/file.txt
```
