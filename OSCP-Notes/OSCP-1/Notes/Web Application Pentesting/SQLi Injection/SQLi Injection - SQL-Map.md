Finally, we can use something that automates the SQL exploits, like **sqlmap**. With this tool we can have automatic scan and checks for any type of vulnerability on the webserver using SQL and It can also automatically upload **reverse shells** to the server. For more information check directly the project documentation [SQL-Map Documentation](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap). A basic usage of sqlmap could be the following code

```shell
sqlmap -u 'http://<target>/page.php?user=test' -p user
```
