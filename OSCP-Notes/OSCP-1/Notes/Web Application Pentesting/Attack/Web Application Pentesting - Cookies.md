HTTP cookies, or internet cookies, are built specifically for web browsers to track, personalize and save information about each user’s session. A “session” is the word used to define the amount of time you spend on a site. Cookies are created to identify you when you visit a new website. The web server — which stores the website’s data — sends a short stream of identifying information to your web browser in the form of cookies. This identifying data (known sometimes as “browser cookies”) is processed and read by “name-value” pairs. These pairs tell the cookies where to be sent and what data to recall. Cookies can be found under **Storage** tab in the Browser inspect settings. Sessions cookies with **secure** flag can be sent only over HTTPS. The HttpOnly tells the browser to deny JavaScript access to cookies.
