Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.

This attack differs from Code Injection, in that code injection allows the attacker to add their own code that is then executed by the application. In Command Injection, the attacker extends the default functionality of the application, which execute system commands, without the necessity of injecting code. For example if a web server executes a command on the operating system below and doesn't sanitize the input, could let the attacker craft a payload with some special characters like `;` or `&&` that are used to concatenate commands in a system. A practical example could be a server that arguments for a known command, eg: ls

```shell
http://<target-url>/pages/command=cmd=ls;id
```

In that case the webserver executes `ls` among with the `id` command.
