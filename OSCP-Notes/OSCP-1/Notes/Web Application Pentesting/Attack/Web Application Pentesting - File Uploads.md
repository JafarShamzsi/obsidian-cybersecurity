For more examples, visit [PHP Reverse Shell - Pentest Monkey](https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell). Going on, with File Upload vulnerabilities we can do a lot of things. A part from uploading a reverse-shell.php, we can also upload in specific places of the file system, dangerous file that could replace original ones. For example, replacing the /etc/passwd and the /etc/shadow file in a system, we could gain permission to log in with a "pre crafted" user. This can be done exploiting a File Upload with something like 

`../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` 
and 
`../../../../../../../../etc/shadow` 

if the server doesn't sanitize file names.
