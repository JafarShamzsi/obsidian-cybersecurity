A Client Side Attack is an attack executed on client side. It could be in the victim's browser or in the victim's computer through malicious executables. This is usually a two-steps attack. In the first step usually we deploy the payload to the victim infrastructure using social engineer and OSINT. After the victim double-clicked the malicious file we sent or opened the malicious link, we can execute arbitrary code for any sort of action we want to do. The aim of Client Side Attacks is to gain an initial foothold in a non-routable internal network.
