The Linux-based job scheduler is known as cron. Scheduled tasks are listed under the
/etc/cron.* directories, where * represents the frequency at which the task will run. For example,
tasks that will be run daily can be found under /etc/cron.daily. Each script is listed in its own
sub-directory.

```shell
ls -lah /etc/cron*
```

It is worth noting that system administrators often add their own scheduled tasks in the
/etc/crontab file. These tasks should be inspected carefully for insecure file permissions, since
most jobs in this particular file will run as root. To view the current userâ€™s scheduled jobs, we can
run crontab followed by the -l parameter.

```shell
crontab -l
```
