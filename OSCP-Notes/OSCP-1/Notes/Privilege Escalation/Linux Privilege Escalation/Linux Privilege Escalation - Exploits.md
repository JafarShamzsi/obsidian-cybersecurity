There are many exploits for many Linux kernel versions out there. We can check the OS Version with cat /etc/os-release. Famous examples of Linux kernel exploits are [DirtyCow](https://dirtycow.ninja/) or [DirtyPipe](https://github.com/AlexisAhmed/CVE-2022-0847-DirtyPipe-Exploits). There is also a recent exploit on the GNU C Library [Looney Tunables](https://github.com/hadrian3689/looney-tunables-CVE-2023-4911) that can work on newer systems as a privilege escalation. An interesting and recent case is the Pkexec Local Privilege Escalation exploit that can be run with [PwnKit](https://github.com/ly4k/PwnKit). Many of this exploits can be found directly with `searchsploit`.
